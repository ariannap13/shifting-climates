      "🚨 BREAKING 🚨 Two more Just Stop Oil supporters were jailed this week for sitting peacefully outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal to demand an end to new oil and gas projects in the UK. The Just Stop Oil supporters who appeared at Queen Elizabeth Court in Birmingham on Tuesday and Wednesday, were accused of breaking the North Warwickshire injunction on 14th September. The private injunction has been designed to help the state protect the profits of the oil industry by effectively outlawing any protest activity near the Kingsbury Oil Terminal. Michelle Charlesworth, 55, a former human resources professional from Oxfordshire was sentenced to 5 months in prison (154 days), after being found guilty of her third breach of the Warwickshire injunction. She was ordered to pay costs of £1415. Michelle’s sentence is reduced by 26 days for the time she has already served on remand. She is likely to serve over two months. Barry Mitchell, 74, a pensioner from Telford, who appeared on Wednesday was sentenced to 70 days in prison, reduced to 24 days for early admission of guilt and time served for his third breach of the Warwickshire injunction. He was ordered to pay costs of £1,180. He is likely to serve two weeks. This is the moment to come together and resist the genocidal death project. We are not prepared to just watch while everything we love is destroyed. We’re done with begging. We are going to stop new oil whether those in power agree or not. As citizens, as humans, as parents and children we have every right under British law to protect ourselves and those we love. This is the moment; we are the last generation that can solve this. Will you step up and join us? If we all come together, we can do this. We can Just Stop Oil. Join us from October 1st in Westminster.\n",

      "🔋 We need to reset our energy system. 🔋 The future of renewable energy is here, and we must take action now. Recently, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a landmark climate bill that marks a significant leap forward in our efforts to address the climate emergency. The IRA is the biggest climate bill in US history, aiming to create a cleaner, more sustainable future for all. By promoting renewable projects and accelerating the transition to a clean energy grid, the IRA is poised to significantly impact our environment and economy. The bill also creates thousands of high-quality jobs and reduces energy costs, making it a win-win for everyone. Unfortunately, a traveling circus of fossil fuel disinformation is derailing counties and townships across the US from approving utility-scale clean energy projects, undermining the IRA, and standing in the way of state-based ambition to pass 100% clean energy legislation. Here’s the truth, the IRA represents a comprehensive approach to tackling the climate emergency, and it is up to us to invest in implementing its benefits. By doing so, we can halt the climate crisis and realize the full potential of this groundbreaking legislation. We need to reset our energy system. Passing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was just a start. We must come together to embrace this renewable future and take the necessary steps toward a more sustainable planet.

'The western, central, and eastern US, Europe, and Asia — with one of the best examples being the Pakistan floods last year which displaced more than 30 million people.'\" ⁠ ⁠ Source: Vox ⁠ ⁠ Follow acespace for a daily dose of empowerment, education, and inspiration for a brighter future! ✨ . . . .\n",

      "Hear from Annabel about the youth climate movement and the IRA. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is the biggest climate investment in history. With its help, the United States could leap into the renewable future and take adequate steps to fight the climate crisis, transition to a renewable future, and bring family-sustaining jobs to places around the country. Don't just take our word for it: Annabel, a Tucson native, believes the IRA \"is the most comprehensive and substantial climate legislation in this country.\" In Tucson, young people are putting the IRA to work through Tucson's Climate Action Adaptation Plan, which looks to utilize IRA funds to implement the plan and combat Tucson's record-breaking heat waves. Together, we can usher in a renewable revolution! Join us in asking governors to utilize IRA funds and bring countless clean energy jobs to your state.\n",

      "The Washburn Fire, a 2,340-acre wildfire that is burning through Yosemite National Park in California, is threatening the famous giant sequoia trees in Mariposa Grove. Firefighters believe that previous prevention efforts, including prescribed burns and clearing of the ground, have lowered the risk of serious harm to trees—some of which might be more than 2,000 years old. They’ve also installed sprinklers around the 209-foot-tall Grizzly Giant sequoia to keep the ground moist and used protective foil to wrap the historic Galen Clark cabin in an attempt to prevent fires. Sequoias actually benefit from some fires, which help to open pinecones and replenish soil. But high-intensity fires like the 2020 Creek Fire are what lead to harmful effects and damage. Park officials evacuated and closed the areas of Wawona and Mariposa Grove.

The Willow Project, developed by ConocoPhillips, will drill for oil in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The project has undergone much scrutiny; the Trump administration approved of 5 drilling pads in 2020, but it was halted by a federal judge in 2021 who said the environmental effect assessment was faulty. The Biden administration has now approved of 3 drilling pads, and environmental organizations have said they will continue attempting to halt the project in court.

The study, which used satellite sensors to get data on the way light radiates from the ocean’s surface, found the change was more noticeable in the latitudes near the equator. The green coloring gives researchers an idea of what’s going on in the ocean’s ecosystems, as green typically means there’s more chlorophyll from phytoplankton and algae. Ocean colors change frequently depending on factors like nutrients rising up and feeding organisms, but the study’s researchers were able to use long-term data. They also compared their findings on the greening with a model that predicted how the climate crisis would affect marine ecosystems — the two matched. However, the color changes don’t correlate with the parts of the ocean that are warming the fastest.

The videos, with titles like ‘Why You Should Love Fossil Fuels,’ ‘The Paris Climate Agreement Won’t Change the Climate,’ and ‘The War On Cars,’ aim to dispel the science behind the climatecrisis and push conservative viewpoints on the approx 3 million students who attend Florida’s public schools. The approval allows educators to choose whether to show the ‘supplemental curriculum’ to students without fear of repercussions. A spokesperson said in a statement, ‘The Florida Department of Education reviewed PragerU Kids and determined the material aligns to Florida’s revised civics and government standards. PragerU Kids is no different than many other resources, which can be used as supplemental materials in Florida schools at district discretion.’ ‘They can take these right-wing, controversial ideas and cloak them in seemingly harmless and friendly rhetoric,’ Adrienne McCarthy, a graduate research assistant at Kansas State University, told E&E News. ‘Then they create this kind of facade of normal conservative beliefs, and they use authoritative figures [in the videos] in order to convince the audience.’\n",

      "At least two buildings collapsed and multiple others were endangered in Juneau, Alaska, after a major glacial dam outburst on August 5 caused the Mendenhall Lake to reach record highs. The city and borough of Juneau issued a local declaration of emergency. Glacial outburst flooding happens when water in a side basin of the Mendenhall Glacier builds up enough pressure to push through the glacier, which generally acts as a dam. The water rushes through the glacier and into the Mendenhall Lake, and on to the river, which floods. Research has found that globalwarming and climatechange heavily impact glaciers. The number, area, and volume of glacial lakes, have drastically grown around the world since 1990 as ice volume has decreased.\n",

      "PopeFrancis issued a 7,000-word document on Oct 4, urging climate deniers and world leaders to take stronger action against the climatecrisis. According to CNN, it was the strongest statement he's made on the issue so far. 'Our responses have not been adequate, while the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point,' he wrote in the document, titled 'Laudate Deum' ('Praise God'). His statement comes ahead of next month's COP28 conference, where world leaders will come together in Dubai, UAE, to discuss issues related to climatechange. 'Despite all attempts to deny, conceal, gloss over or relativize the issue, the signs of climate change are here and increasingly evident. No one can ignore the fact that in recent years we have witnessed extreme weather phenomena, frequent periods of unusual heat, drought and other cries of protest,' Francis wrote. The pope also called out high-income countries, like the U.S., which are responsible for a disproportionate level of emissions. 'If we consider that emissions per individual in the United States are about two times greater than those of individuals living in China, and about seven times greater than the average of the poorest countries, we can state that a broad change in the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model would have a significant long-term impact,' he wrote. In addition to drawing attention to the U.S., Francis also mentioned the shortcomings of businesses and even his own church. 'The climate crisis is not exactly a matter that interests the great economic powers, whose concern is with the greatest profit possible at minimal cost and in the shortest amount of time,' he wrote, adding, 'I feel obliged to make these clarifications, which may appear obvious, because of certain dismissive and scarcely reasonable opinions that I encounter, even within the Catholic Church.'\n",

      "Japanese researchers discovered that microplastics, which come from consumer products and industrial waste, exist in our clouds and could be contributing to climatechange. Researchers collected water samples from mist around the peaks of MountFuji and Mount Oyama. After testing the samples, they found 9 types of polymers and one type of rubber. According to their findings, which were recently published in the journal Environmental Chemistry Letters, they observed that there were 6.7 to 13.9 pieces of microplastics per liter. The researchers said this is the first report of microplastics being found in cloud water, and they’re concerned about what this could mean for climate change and the environment. ‘Microplastics in the free troposphere are transported and contribute to global pollution,’ Hiroshi Okochi, one of the researchers, said in a statement. ‘If the issue of ‘plastic air pollution’ is not addressed proactively, climate change and ecological risks may become a reality, causing irreversible and serious environmental damage in the future.’\n",

      "The International Energy Agency released a new report on September 26, which found that the rollout of climate-friendly technology has left open the pathway to keeping globalwarming at no more than 1.5ºC (2.7ºF). However, due to increasing greenhousegas emissions, the deployment of clean tech like renewableenergy and electricvehicles needs to speed up to keep us on track. The 1.5ºC goal was set in the Paris Agreement of 2015, reflecting the warming threshold that scientists for years have said is necessary to avoid the worst climate disasters. The Earth is already at least 1.1ºC warmer on average than it was at preindustrial levels, and the effects of the climatecrisis are being felt in the extreme drought, heat, and intense storms that are having widespread effects on agriculture, disease, and biodiversity. While the pathway to 1.5ºC is narrowing, the report finds that it's still possible, giving people all the more hope to continue fighting for governments, organizations, and companies to keep decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

      "The sea ice around Antarctica was extremely low this past winter, with almost 400,000 fewer square miles of sea ice compared to the previous record for lowest maximum coverage. The preliminary numbers were released by the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, which said a more complete analysis will be coming next month, according to Reuters. Antarctica usually has its maximum ice extent in September, with the coverage melting away to its lowest levels in February or March, as the seasons are flipped in the Southern Hemisphere. Scientists are worried about how the low ice year will affect the ecosystem and globalwarming. Many animals, including penguins, reproduce on the sea ice, so without it, their populations will likely be harmed. In addition, the bright white of the ice reflects some of the sun’s heat back into the atmosphere. Without it, scientists are concerned the heat will instead be absorbed into the Earth, raising temperatures.\n",

      "In a new study from the University of Bristol in collaboration with the University of Leeds, researchers shared what they called the first-ever supercomputer models of the climate in the far-off distant future. The research, published September 25 in the journal Nature Geoscience, found that Earth’s continents will eventually reform into one large supercontinent that is likely to be too hot and dry for most mammals to inhabit. The supercontinent is expected to form in the next 250 million years, and only 8-16% of it would potentially be habitable to mammals. ‘The newly-emerged supercontinent would effectively create a triple whammy, comprising the continentality effect, hotter sun and more CO2 in the atmosphere, of increasing heat for much of the planet. The result is a mostly hostile environment devoid of food and water sources for mammals,’ said lead author Alexander Farnsworth, who is a senior research associate at the University of Bristol. Co-author Eunice Lo, a research fellow at the University of Bristol, added, ‘It is vitally important not to lose sight of our current climate crisis, which is a result of human emissions of greenhouse gases. While we are predicting an uninhabitable planet in 250 million years, today we are already experiencing extreme heat that is detrimental to human health. This is why it is crucial to reach net-zero emissions as soon as possible.’\n",

      "A new report by nonprofit Corporate Accountability and the Guardian found that, of the 100 top carbon offset projects around the world, 78% had at least one fundamental issue that undermined emission promises and made them ‘likely junk.’ Of the remaining projects, 16% were ‘problematic,’ with ‘evidence suggesting they may have at least one fundamental failing,’ and 6% had insufficient information available. Carbon credits are tradable certificates that allow organizations and corporations to invest in any environmental project that ‘captures’ carbon to keep it out of the atmosphere. The credits are typically bought to offset greenhousegas emissions that are burned. Of the 78% of projects that are ‘likely junk,’ $1.16 billion carbon credits have been traded. The projects that offer carbon credits include forestry, hydroelectric dams, solar and wind farms, waste disposal, and greener household appliances schemes. Those projects were judged against the Guardian and Corporate Accountability’s classification system. They looked at a number of factors, such as ‘leakage,’ a.k.a. if the project would just cause emissions somewhere else; exaggerated or overestimated claims; how long the carbon would stay trapped; or if the project would have happened without the carbon credit system.\n",

The month was .4°C (.7°F) hotter than the previous record set in 2019. ‘The amount that we’re smashing records by is shocking,’ said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus Climate Change Service, a European organization monitoring global temperatures. Copernicus predicts that 2023 is all but guaranteed to be the hottest year on record. The overall warming of the planet will lead to more intense weather disasters, like droughts and hurricanes. Arizona, hit a record 54 days of 110°F heat. The city suffered the hottest 3-month period since record-keeping began this year, with June, July, and August having a combined average temperature of 97°F. In July alone, the daily average temperature was a scorching 102.7°F. The West Coast also experienced a heat wave this summer, with heat alerts covering Oregon and Washington, even into British Columbia and California. Various places in the region smashed previous heat records. This was made with support from Climate Power.\n",

Climate positive is defined as “removing more climate gases than the value chain emits while at the same time reducing emissions in line with the 1.5 degree goal from Paris. Max Burgers ensures that each item on its menu is “climate positive”, taking into account all emissions from the “farmers land to the guests hand”, while even including the customer's journey back and forth to the restaurant. This has required extensive efforts by the company to measure its entire footprint. Each item on Max Burger’s menu includes a CO2e label to empower customers to better understand the climate impact of food and guide them towards options with a lower carbon footprint.

Following Hurricane Maria in 2017, the Prime Minister of Dominica announced his plan to transform the nation into the first “climate resilient” Small Island Developing State. Electriciens sans frontières (Electricians Without Borders France) was one of the first NGOs to answer the country’s call for assistance, with an ambitious plan to help restore electricity to health centres following worsening natural disasters. Following the emergency, Electriciens sans frontières put forward a solution designed to assess and retrofit vital public health infrastructure with stand alone photovoltaic kits. These kits use renewable energy to secure an “emergency pocket” of power needs for six health centers on the island. At the same time, the project also contributes to reducing electricity costs through the development of a pilot model on the largest installation to inject any surplus solar energy into the national grid. This pilot solution was deployed to meet the requirements of public health infrastructure during natural disasters, while also tackling climate change through adaptation and mitigation measures.

      "Women are leading a food revolution with OLIO, the world's only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app. OLIO is co-founded and led by women and two-thirds of the app’s users are women. App users tackle the problem of food waste by connecting with their neighbours, local shops, and cafes, to share leftover food in their community. Approximately half of the food on the app comes from neighbours sharing their spare food, and half comes from ‘Food Waste Heroes’ - volunteers who collect unsold food from local shops, take it home, add it to the app, and redistribute it to the community.

      "In 2013, the Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED), launched a breakthrough initiative to train young women from poor, marginalized farming communities across sub-Saharan Africa with support from the Mastercard Foundation and EARTH University. Through this training, these young women become Agriculture Guides – champions of sustainable agriculture. These young women have improved the productivity, sustainability and profitability of their own smallholdings as well as encouraged wide adoption of practical, affordable and locally-relevant climate-smart techniques. This includes inter-cropping and drip irrigation using waste plastic bottles and technologies that value Indigenous traditions. As a result of this initiative, a movement of young women are now leading effective action on climate change through sustainable agriculture in rural Africa. Already, over 8,500 individuals, mostly women and young people, have been reached through demo-farms, community meetings and mentoring, and Agriculture Guides are continuing to reach young people in their communities to build their resilience to climate challenges. CAMFED aims to equip 50,000 more young women in rural Africa with climate-smart knowledge and skills over the next five years. -- ClimateAction\n",

      "On an intense spiritual quest, Qismat Ali wraps himself in iron bells and embarks on a grueling 200-kilometer pilgrimage across the scorching deserts of Pakistan. Filmmakers Matthieu Paley and Sebastian Feehan met while on assignment, both drawn to far-flung places. Paley spoke of a mysterious group of Sufi pilgrims he encountered in 2008 wearing bells and chains. They had told him of their journey across Pakistan's inhospitable desert. Last year, the duo went in search of the pilgrims, who accepted these strangers into their circle. They followed in their footsteps, ate together, shared the little available water, slept under the stars. They all walked fast and purposefully. This is a story of a group who are tough yet tender and whose devotion endures in the name of love, connection, and tradition. The filmmakers shine a light on a part of the world and a group that are underrepresented and often misunderstood. \n",

      "On an intense spiritual quest, Qismat Ali wraps himself in iron bells and embarks on a grueling 200-kilometer pilgrimage across the scorching deserts of Pakistan. Filmmakers Matthieu Paley and Sebastian Feehan met while on assignment, both drawn to far-flung places. Paley spoke of a mysterious group of Sufi pilgrims he encountered in 2008 wearing bells and chains. They had told him of their journey across Pakistan's inhospitable desert. Last year, the duo went in search of the pilgrims, who accepted these strangers into their circle. They followed in their footsteps, ate together, shared the little available water, slept under the stars. They all walked fast and purposefully. This is a story of a group who are tough yet tender and whose devotion endures in the name of love, connection, and tradition. The filmmakers shine a light on a part of the world and a group that are underrepresented and often misunderstood.

It comes after India was accused of watering down a COP26 climate deal to cut coal consumption. Air quality in the city has been hovering between \"severe\" and \"hazardous\" for several days. Burning of crop stubble, industrial and vehicular pollution, and weather patterns turn the city's air noxious every winter. But the air in the capital and other areas remains poor most of the year. Pollutants from coal-fired power plants are among the culprits. Despite pressure on India and China, two of the world's top carbon emitters, to sign a deal to end coal use, the two big consumers of coal proposed a last-minute change in wording - countries have now agreed to \"phase down\" rather than \"phase out\" coal.\n",

However many expressed disappointment with the agreement and warned that the world was still on course for disastrous warming. The summit reached deadlock over coal power after India and China blocked a call for it to be completely phased out. Instead the summit could only agree that it would be “phased down”. The UK, which hosted the summit, hailed the deal as a “game-changing agreement”. But critics warned that it does not deliver the key summit goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century. The summit did agree to provide money for poorer countries to help them adapt to climate change, as well as curbs to methane emissions and deforestation.

But the crisis did not begin or end with the Grenfell Tower fire. Over the past five years, we’ve been discovering just how many homes have been constructed over decades with materials that are deemed to be unsafe - and buildings that ,even now, are still being built using them. The burden has fallen predominantly on the people who bought their properties believing the work to be sound. They now face demands for remedial payments in the tens of thousands - and find themselves unable to insure their homes or secure mortgages. Worse still, they can’t sell them and many are financially and physically trapped. Newsnight’s Lewis Goodall delves into the bigger picture and reports on the breadth and scale of the building safety crisis.\n",

Increasingly it's the police and a Newsnight investigation reveals there's been a massive rise in mental health call-outs by people who’ve rung the police across the UK. In Merseyside, mental-health related incidents have gone up 313% in 5 years. Some police chiefs think it's down to lack of mental health services in the community and officers increasingly being seen as the first resort for people in a crisis.

Where more permanent accommodation is unavailable, Home Office policy is to house them in hotels around the country, at a cost of approximately £4.7 million a day. With public services in many of the towns they are placed in already stretched, this is causing friction with local communities who feel ignored by those who are deciding where to house people.

      "Burning fossil fuels is heating the planet. But if we quit our fossil fuel habit and stop emitting greenhouse gases... what happens then? Answers seem to vary from \"global warming will stop\" to \"we can expect more and more climate change to come\". So which is right? And what would it really take to stop climate change and protect ourselves as much as possible?\n",

But scientists fear that by heating the planet and melting the Greenland ice-sheet, we're already slowing it down, with the risk that it could collapse - a potential tipping point with huge consequences around the world. And a new study (published in 2023) has tried to pin down what could happen, when. So what do we actually known about this current, does it have anything to do with the Gulf Stream, and is there anything we can do to protect ourselves?\n",

They were freed by a mass protest movement across Britain. In 2021 climate activists are jailed for highlighting the crisis that threatens us all: we meet in solidarity and to defend the right to protest, under threat more than ever from the government’s repressive Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. ‘We raise the watch-word, liberty: We will, we will, we will be free!’ George Loveless, Tolpuddle Martyr, Shire Hall, March 1834\n",

At the eleventh hour before the Government’s authoritarian new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill looks set to pass into law, activists and concerned citizens from multiple movements are gathering in Abingdon Street Gardens, Westminster, to hold a candlelit vigil. This is a celebration of everything peaceful protest has brought us. It is also a solemn moment marking a turning point in public life, in which British people’s democratic right to object is about to be ripped away. Today, the House of Lords began amending the PCSC Bill. Recently, Priti Patel added 18 pages of new measures to the Bill without allowing adequate time for debate: these include chilling jail terms for new offences, including attending or encouraging people to attend a noisy or disruptive protest, ‘locking on’ to anyone/anything and blocking roads. This is the last opportunity for any changes to be made to a Bill which clamps down on even the mildest forms of protest in England and further criminalises (and makes near impossible) the cultural traditional way of life of Gypsy Roma and Traveller communities.

      "Two-time Paralympian gold medallist James Brown climbed on the roof of a commercial airliner on the 10th of October 2019, to highlight the dire extent of the climate crisis and ultimately paid the price. The only real crime he committed was caring about his children and all the children of the world. This documentary ‘Man on Plane’ delves deep into the emotional struggle of James who is visually impaired, the reasons why he took this action, dealing with climate anxiety and coming to terms with the severe legal consequences. The jailing of James for six months coincides with the failed 26th Conference of Parties (COP26). The conservative scientific consensus is 2.4 degrees of Global warming. This is a death sentence to hundreds of millions of people, leading to cascading tipping points and will change our planet forever. The future of life hangs in the balance of what we do over the next few short years. James action was a wake-up call to humanity. The Governments response to climate protesters is to jail the protesters and this raises the question - who are the real criminals?\n",

      "Extinction Rebellion announces plans for April 2022: ‘The COP process has failed, it’s up to all of us now’ Please Donate: Extinction Rebellion UK responds to the failure of the COP process with plans to mobilise two million in the UK towards mass civil disobedience, with the first major campaign of civil resistance taking place in April 2022. The COP process has failed even by its own standards, the most important of which being limiting temperature increases to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels. The IPCC says that in order to avoid breaching 1.5˚C, global emissions need to fall by 45% by 2030. [1] Following COP26, according to the commitments made by the attending nations, the world is on track for a 16% increase in emissions by 2030. [2] COP26 failed to heed the calls of experts, including the IPCC Chair, Dr. Hoesung Lee, for \"immediate, rapid, global wide-ranging\" global emissions decline. In the words of the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa, COP26 leaves the human race continuing to “invest in our own extinction.” Nuala Gathercole Lam of Extinction Rebellion, said: “The tragic lack of action is not for a shortage of potential solutions to the climate crisis, but down to a lack of political will to make difficult changes that threaten powerful financial interests. For real progress to be made in future climate talks, one of the major polluting nations must step up and break the deadlock. “The theory behind Extinction Rebellion is that mass participation in civil disobedience - on the doorstep of the government, media and elites - is our best shot at creating the political conditions for the UK to step up and play that role.” Research carried out by Erica Chenowith, a political scientist at Harvard University, and Maria Stephan, a researcher at the International Centre for Nonviolent Conflict, found that over the course of the twentieth century movements which achieved active engagement of at least 3.5 percent of the population have never failed to bring about significant social and political change. [3] In the UK that is 2.3 million people. Following the large numbers Extinction Rebellion brought onto the streets in April and October 2019, the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 forced the movement towards smaller, more targeted, and by their nature more covid safe, actions. Now the civil disobedience group will return to its roots, rolling out a nationwide programme of door to door canvassing, talks, trainings and mass participation civil disobedience campaigns, with the aim of engaging 2.3 million people. Gathercole Lam added: “While our mass participation campaigns of April and October 2019 played a significant role in driving forward the recognition of the climate and ecological crisis - the UK parliament was the first to declare a climate emergency, our government was the first major economy to sign a net zero date into law and the British public have the highest levels of climate concern globally - XR’s actions have not yet brought about the real action on the part of government needed to reduce emissions and restore biodiversity. “That’s why in 2022 we will be working to grow our numbers and developing designs for civil resistance campaigns, the first of which will take place in April 2022. Our mobilisation programme will continue to build numbers through the year with the aim of achieving XR’s three demands. “The failure of COP26, and indeed the COP process generally, is devastating but not surprising - it is clearer than ever now that it's up to all of us.” [4] [5] The April date will be released in the New Year.

      "On the 16th of November, 9 nonviolent protesters will be sentenced to up to two years in prison for breaking an injunction on protesting on the M25 with Insulate Britain. They are part of a group of over thirty who could face similar sentences over the coming months. As we watch COP26 fail to deliver, now is the moment to speak up, to stand together, and to proudly defend the right and the need to have disruptive disobedience as part of a thriving healthy democracy. As a means to create the change we need to protect people and societies from the crisis which threatens all life on earth. We will hear from a panel with experience of taking civil disobedience on why this is the moment for us all to step up. Chair: Clare Farrell – Clare is a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion and now coordinates the movement’s media team. She took part in a women’s action highlighting HSBC’s role in the climate crisis earlier this year and faces jail time for her civil disobedience. Panel: Roman Paluch-Machnik, Roman has been organising with Extinction Rebellion since 2018. This year he travelled the country, running people’s assemblies in neglected communities to understand what we’re worried about and what we have in common as a nation. He is also part of Insulate Britain and one of the Highway 9 facing jail time. Angie Zelter – Angie is an activist who has initiated and participated in numerous campaigns against nuclear weapons, militarisation, deforestation and human rights abuses. As a global citizen expressing solidarity she has often been arrested and incarcerated for many months in different countries and is the author of 6 books, the latest of which is called ‘Activism for Life’ Frank Hewetson – Frank has been an Action Coordinator with Greenpeace for the last 30 years. He is based in London and has worked on pretty much every GP campaign and across the Globe. He’s 56 years old, has two children, a long criminal record, and is banned from three countries and doesn’t really regret a moment of it especially as we are now at such a truly critical juncture. Orla Murphy – Orla is a 20-year-old Irish climate activist who dropped out of college and was sent to prison for her protest against the Irish government’s inaction on the climate emergency.\n",

This action seeks to raise awareness of the vicious circle of war and fossil fuel extraction: military force is often deployed to sustain the extractive industries destabilising our climate, yet oil is the leading cause of war, with links to an estimated 25 to 50% of all interstate wars since 1973. All over the world, those who fight to protect their lands from extractive industries are also often met with state and paramilitary violence. Fossil fuels are killing us.

      "- XRUK Position on COP26 - XRUK Political Circle Statement on COP26 The wildfires, the storms, the lethal heatwaves, the droughts, the melting glaciers, the sea level rises we have experienced in recent years are only a taste of what the world’s richest nations are setting us up for. Ecosystems are being destroyed. Species are being wiped out. Tipping points are looming and may already have been passed. There will be no going back. And this is what was predicted by scientists. Lives and livelihoods are being shattered and millions of lives have already been lost. Hundreds of millions are already being hammered by the fallout from the still growing carbon economy and the breakdown of our climate and nature. Their children’s futures are being betrayed. Your children’s futures are being betrayed. They will not forgive. Yet governments, in bed with fossil fuel companies and other anti-climate industries whose armies of lobbyists stalk the halls of parliaments across the world, have largely ignored these warnings and knowingly continued to allow the expansion of the sources of death and destruction. Decades of denial, inaction, and exponential increases in carbon emissions have led us to this point. We have emitted more carbon since governments have been meeting to address the climate crisis than in the entirety of human history beforehand. Our governments committed to try and keep global warming under 1.5C six years ago. Rich countries promised to provide $100bn a year by 2020 to support decarbonised, sustainable development in poor countries. But since then global carbon emissions have continued to rise. Since then governments have spent more subsidising fossil fuels than they have on policies to meet their commitments—using taxpayers’ money to fund their own destruction. Since then the UK government, as host of COP26, commissioned a report from the International Energy Agency that stated categorically that there could be no new fossil fuel projects from now on if we are to stay below 1.5C—yet the UK government, like many others, continues to licence new projects. Since then the rich countries, responsible for 92% of excess emissions in the atmosphere, have broken their inadequate promises to the poor countries. Since then the ecological destruction has accelerated apace. They cannot say they did not know. This is a crime against humanity.\n",

      "Over 200 environmental pilgrims, inspired by all faiths and none, are arriving by low-carbon means in Glasgow today from all over Europe to participate in the COP26 climate summit. In a moving display of cross-border solidarity, Extinction Rebellion marches originating in London and Zaragoza, Spain are converging with the Ecumenical Pilgrimage for Climate Justice from Poland, Sweden and Germany, the Young Christian Climate Network and the Pilgrimage for COP26 from Dunbar, Scotland. Having collectively covered thousands of miles, the walkers will be joined within the city limits by a colourful procession, samba drummers and a group of indigenous leaders. Inspired both by the faith tradition of pilgrimage and great justice marches of the past – the Jarrow March in the UK, the Salt March in India and the March on Washington in the US – the purpose of this quiet activism is to advocate for climate justice. From the strictures of Covid-19 to the phenomenal costs of travel, this is the most exclusionary COP ever. People in the Global South, who are most affected by the climate emergency yet have contributed the least to it – must not be sidelined at these historic negotiations. Our livestreamers will also be joined by people travelling by other unusual means to Glasgow: the Cycle to COP ride from Brighton and the specially organised Rail to the COP train carrying climate activists from the Low Countries and France.\n",

      "Extinction Rebellion protestors gained entry to the UK’s largest oil refinery early this morning, cutting its electrified perimeter fences and locking on to structures across the site. Some have scaled two 50-foot oil silos and unfurled two banners that proclaim: “Climate Emergency” and “No Future in Fossil Fuels”. Just three days before the COP26 Climate Summit, they are demanding that the UK Government listens to the people and stops all fossil fuel investments NOW. The campaigners also condemn ExxonMobil’s massive expansion of its diesel production facilities at Fawley, despite the International Energy Agency (IEA) warning that all new fossil fuel developments must stop this year to keep the world within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. ExxonMobil has known the devastating effects of fossil fuel production on the environment for over 40 years, but instead of acting responsibly on that knowledge, they've spent tens of millions funding climate denial and misinformation and obstructing a transition to cleaner energy sources. Only decarbonisation of our economies will limit the scale of death, destruction and mass extinction that climate change will bring in decades to come, the effects of which are already being felt around the world.

What we do, I believe, in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity\". Sir David King. Former Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Government. Given there is a real world out there and we have 3-4 years to stop it being destroyed, we have to engage in nonviolent direct action to stop governments imposing upon us the greatest act of criminality in the history of humanity: namely destroying the livelihoods and lives of the next thousand generations. This video gives you the key elements of success which people are adapting as they step into their responsibilities to force political change. Nothing is more important. We can not longer afford to lose. \"We struggle to name any climate scientist who at that time thought the Paris Agreement was feasible. We have since been told by some scientists that the Paris Agreement was “of course important for climate justice but unworkable” and “a complete shock, no one thought limiting to 1.5°C was possible”. Rather than being able to limit warming to 1.5°C, a senior academic involved in the IPCC concluded we were heading beyond 3°C by the end of this century.\" The future of the human niche paper:\n",

Protesting against the shockingly high levels of CO2 private flights emit per passenger – up to 40 times more than scheduled flights – we are calling on the polluter elite of celebrities, oligarchs, business leaders and the world’s super-rich to ditch private flights and the UK Government to outlaw private air travel now.

      "PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER – NOT ‘WORLD LEADERS’ We cannot trust them to do what’s necessary at COP26. The Climate and Ecological Emergency is a Crime Against Humanity perpetrated by the rich and powerful, and the COP process is systematically corrupted by vested interests – national, corporate and financial. GOING BEYOND COP The truth is, we can not rely on COP. Nothing on the table in the run up to COP26 resembles a compassionate and functional response to the crisis, so why should we place any faith in the summit itself? What we expect is catastrophic failure, which will be spun by the government as a success to an unsuspecting public. Both the governments represented and the NGOs will be promoting an atmosphere of optimism and possibility. Our role is to tell the truth, to expose both the failings and the falsehoods, to force leaders to confront the reality and the consequences of their failure and offer people a meaningful route to change through Citizens’ Assemblies. Extinction Rebellion as a movement is capable of setting its own agenda and schedule. We’re not bound by the political calendar. Our theory of change has achieved most success when we act within our own timeline and when politicians and the media least expect it. In 2022, when global governments show us once again they are not capable of tackling this crisis, many people will all be asking, “So, what do we do now?” Our response to that will be mass nonviolent civil disobedience. Because it’s people who have the power – not World leaders.\n",

Also on the menu: Forest Rebellion protests against the colonisation of the indigenous Sami people and the Rebellion of One returns to display the fear and vulnerability of individuals in the face of the Climate and Ecological Emergency. Nature is in crisis. A species goes extinct every 5 minutes. We have lost almost 70% of all plant and animal life on this planet in just 50 years, due to overexploitation of the Earth’s resources through mining, urbanisation and hyper-intensive agriculture – and now, through climate change. False solutions are being promoted by NGOs and governments, which would displace the best guardians of the world’s ecosystems, indigenous peoples, who already protect 80% of the world’s biodiversity. We march to demand that governments and the private sector STOP THE HARM and transition to a sustainable future that safeguards the diversity of life on our only planet. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issues a stark warning of a “code red for humanity”, the UK Government is failing us and future generations by refusing to take bold, immediate action on the climate and ecological emergency.

Friday's actions will shine a spotlight on this devastation, as we move like water, flooding the City of London ourselves! Protesting against fossil fuel companies, investors, banks and the government to stop their greed and need for fossil fuel. As we take a stand against the unfolding climate catastrophe and call for action and demand the: - Stopping of new fossil fuels investment - Tell The Truth Life on Earth is in crisis: scientists agree we have entered a period of abrupt climate breakdown, and we are in the midst of a mass extinction of our own making. - Act Now The time for denial is over. It is time to act. - Beyond Politics If we are to have any hope of coping with the emergency, we have to move beyond the politics that have so far held us back, and into listening, dialogue and towards unity and action. Join us for the penultimate rebellion mass action as we build pressure on the financial institutions with our nonviolent tactics.\n",

      "IN CASE OF CLIMATE EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS: At 7am on the 1st of September 2021, 8 women lined up at the European office of JP Morgan at Embankment and carefully broke 2 windows with hammers and chisels. Wearing all black, the women used painted hammers with words such as LIFE, LOVE and CARE on them to break glass at the ‘World’s worst bank’. Before doing so they stuck stickers to the windows that read ‘In case of climate emergency, break glass’. Care was taken to make sure no one inside or nearby the building was put at risk of harm. After the glass was broken, the women sat down in front of the bank in a circle and waited for the police to arrive. They were wearing patches that read ‘Deeds not words’ and ‘Stop the harm’. The action is the continuation of a campaign by people taking similar acts of careful and deliberate property damage at banks responsible for funding and accelerating the climate and ecological emergency. JP Morgan was targeted to highlight the banks’ suicidal business model which is pushing the planet to breaking point and it is the world’s worst bank for funding fossil fuels, having invested $317bn into them since the Paris Climate Agreement was signed 5 years ago. The bank currently has no commitment to drop clients who don’t align with staying with 1.5 degrees, and no commitment to zero out financed emissions. They are also masters of ‘greenwashing’, having said they would be “powered by renewables by 2020.\n",

      "From 30 July to 2 August 2021, over 20 actions in 15 countries will protest against gas expansion, fracking and colonialism, as part of the umbrella movement, Shale Must Fall. The fossil fuel industry who extract fossil gas, much of it fracked gas, from the Global South and import to Global North countries, are committing climate colonialism. These companies based in Europe, where most countries have fracking bans or moratoriums, are exploiting resources in countries in the Global South with the very same destructive extraction methods. It is time to urgently put an end to this injustice. Shale Must Fall brings together indigenous earth protectors, grass-roots activists in the Global South, solidarity groups in the Global North, such as Germany’s Ende Gelände, and the worldwide movement, Extinction Rebellion.

This was predicted by Schellnhuber, one of Europe’s most eminent scientists, then director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, on the premise that if the build-up of greenhouse gases and its consequences were to push global temperatures 9°F higher than those of March 2009. Current world population: 7.9 billion. One of the main reasons why youth are so demoralised about their future is that older people lie to them, and young people know this. Older people lie to them about the climate crisis – that is it not as bad as it actually is – that 1.5°C is still attainable. Unless we come up with some miracle technology, it is not. Worse still, older people lie to them about what it takes to make real political change. Going on a march and standing outside schools doesn’t even reach the foothills of effectiveness. Only mass non-violent civil resistance (thousands of youth blocking ‘business as usual’ and getting arrested and going to prison) is in the ball park of creating the massive change that everyone knows is now necessary. The following quote is the founding ethical basis of Extinction Rebellion and Burning Pink, “To love truth for its own sake is the principal part of perfection in this world and the seed-plot of all other virtues” - John Locke The basis of respect to another person is to be truthful with them, even when that truth feels unbearable. Roger Hallam shows this respect in this video. Young people face annihilation, which means the collapse of their societies into an endless hell of rape, slaughter and starvation, unless they enter into non-violent civil resistance against the carbon addicted political regimes which are taking them to their death. This is the way it is. If this video has interested you, check out international youth organisation Last Generation. Last Generation calls for non-violent REVOLUTION. “Our Generation is forced to do this - we have no choice. We have a duty thrust upon us when the government is guilty of treason.

      "A few weeks ago, the Science Museum announced that it will re-open to the public on the 19th May with a new exhibition, called “Our Future Planet”, which sees Royal Dutch Shell as a major sponsor. The exhibition has been described by the museum itself as “the UK’s first major exhibition on Carbon Capture and Storage” (CCS) and it will open on the 19th May 2021. Why do we believe that partnering with Shell is completely inappropriate for an institution that aims to promote good science? Over the course of decades, Shell has been responsible for repeated oil spills and appalling abuses of human rights, including the systematic pollution of the Niger Delta region, which is home to a million people. Why on earth would we expect them to clean their CO2 pollution out of the atmosphere? Shell has a long history of spreading cynical misinformation and lobbying against climate regulation, despite knowing about climate change for decades. Between 2018 and 2020, Shell invested over 90 percent of their capital in fossil fuels, with only 3-5 percent in renewable energy. Shell plans to maintain considerable production of oil and increase production of natural gas by 20 percent in the coming decades. Several reports have shown that Shell’ business plans are not aligned with the Paris Agreement. Shell has claimed to reach net-zero by 2050. However, Shell’s plans for net zero rely on unfeasible levels of offsetting and carbon capture and storage (CCS), with experts defining such plans as a distraction from the urgent need to cut fossil fuel emissions now.

      "You can’t have climate change without sacrifice zones, and you can’t have sacrifice zones without disposable people, and you can’t have disposable people without racism. (Hop Hopkins) In August 2020, cultural anthropologist Sandra Niessen published the seminal article: Fashion, its Sacrifice Zone and Sustainability. Using a decolonial perspective, Niessen investigates why and how the clothing systems of the Other have been systematically undervalued and obscured by the fashion system of the Global North, and instead proposes a “revision to the customary framework of sustainability that is being used by dress scholars, environmental activists and policy makers, so that it includes the putative “non-fashion” clothing traditions of the world.” In Fashion Act Now’s third panel investigating Fashion & Degrowth, Niessen will be in conversation with Extinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell, looking at why an ethical, ecologically aware fashion system must also be a decolonised fashion system. \"Sacrifice zones are resource-rich lands, generally associated with minority communities that are considered dispensable and exploited for economic gain. Rather than expendable physical landscapes, fashion sacrifice zones are dress traditions, and their makers, associated with fashion’s Other half, that are destroyed for and by the expansion of industrial fashion. These zones facilitate industrial expansion because they are a source of cheap labor and also indigenous design (commonly appropriated) important for style change. They also serve as markets when indigenous dress is replaced with industrially produced dress. And finally, they are the major sites of waste disposal, including secondhand clothing (Rodgers 2015).\" Sandra Niessen Racism brought us the climate crisis, and it will take transformative anti-racism to solve it. (Eric Holthaus) ABOUT FASHION ACT NOW Fashion Act Now is campaign group calling for environmental justice within the fashion industry. We advocate for decolonisation, just transitions and regenerative practices. Born out of and supporting Extinction Rebellion, we're a team of fashion insiders who believe we need to address the elephant in the room: that the fashion industry in the Global North is too wedded to models of exponential growth and profit to “mark its own homework” any longer.

      "At 11am May 1st, two years to the day since the UK Parliament declared a climate emergency, over 200 people across the UK are taking part in In multiple courageous acts of nonviolent civil disobedience, people are sitting alone in the face of oncoming traffic in towns and cities around the UK - including Scarborough, Weymouth, Birmingham, Oxford, Ipswich, Lincoln, Canterbury, Newcastle, Portishead, London, Newquay, Swansea, Bangor in Northern Ireland and many more. We'll bring you live to several of these actions during the stream. This vulnerable act of peaceful civil disobedience by people across the UK shows the fear and frustration felt by many at the failure of the UK Government to take the climate and ecological crisis seriously. Two years on from Parliament’s declaration of emergency and emissions are going up, airports are being allowed to expand and £27bn is being poured into roadbuilding. Boris Johnson recently announced that the UK would ‘toughen’ its climate targets, pledging to cut emissions by 78% by 2035, compared to 1990 levels. This Government is good at creating positive headlines on climate, but the organisations tasked with monitoring their progress tell a different story… In December last year, the National Audit Office found that the government UK Government is predicted to fail to meet its existing climate targets and said that a radical reassessment of priorities was needed. Two years and the Government still won’t accept the severity of the climate crisis, but we refuse to be bystanders while the world burns! Similar Rebellion of One actions have already taken place in other countries, including in Poland, the Netherlands and Germany.

What we’ve produced is more than a traditional strategy document - it’s a call to action; it’s an acknowledgement of past mistakes and a thank you to all the amazing rebels who’ve kept going during an incredibly difficult year; and it’s also a toolkit stuffed for where to go from here. It’s an expression of where we are as a movement at this absolutely pivotal moment in time. Read the short strategy here: Full document:\n",

      "The British courts are NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE. Dave McKenny refused to comply with his Extinction Rebellion trial at City of London Magistrates court on 22 April, Earth Day. He wanted to highlight that UK courts are a pillar of power which is facilitating the death of billions of people this century owing to non-linear, irreversible climate change. The courts are permitting the massively carbon-intensive and environmentally destructive HS2, the expansion of Heathrow, new coal mines etc. At the same time, since 2018 the British Magistrates courts have heard over 1100 XR cases, with many rebels receiving guilty verdicts which means fines, conditional discharges, prosecution costs and criminal convictions. The British courts are criminalising peaceful protestors, ordinary people who are simply asking for meaningful action on the climate crisis from lawmakers, industry leaders, finance sectors and the government. The magistrate found Dave in Contempt of Court and sent him to prison for 14 days. Dave, a community musician who works with young people in healthcare settings, sees what he is doing as his DUTY OF CARE in action. Young people, here in the UK and around the world, are losing their lives due to toxic air pollution, which is just one fatal impact of the climate and ecological emergency. He cannot stand by as billions of people around the world increasingly face death, famine and the outbreak of war, with every year of governmental inaction. Dave sees his stretch in prison as nothing compared to the daily risk faced by frontline earth protectors around the world, like those defending the precious Amazon, Congolese and Indonesian rainforests, the lungs of our planet. In 2019, 212 land and environmental activists were murdered. WE ARE IN A SOCIAL, ECOLOGICAL AND HEALTH EMERGENCY AND WE MUST ACT NOW! disobeyinthedockgmail.com\n",

      "‘This is an act of care’ – Extinction Rebellion women break windows at HSBC Canary Wharf HQ in latest action to highlight the financing of climate breakdown. At 7am on Thursday 22nd of April, the 51st Earth Day, nine women from Extinction Rebellion and political party Burning Pink broke windows at the HSBC headquarters in Canary Wharf. The women wore patches with the words ‘better broken windows than broken promises’ in reference to the Suffragettes acts of civil disobedience, which are widely credited with winning women the right to vote in the UK. They placed stickers on the windows of the bank reading ‘£80 billion into fossil fuels in the last 5 years.’ After carefully breaking the glass using hammers and chisels the women sat down and waited to be arrested.

      "Livestreamed court video here: Stefania Morosi, an XR Rebel in court today extending non-cooperation at the City of London Magistrates Court, 16 February, 2021 The argument of ‘Necessity’ does not seem to impress the judicial system, yet our actions are necessary and essential. “The facts are clear. For thirty years the British Government has been told by the scientific community that continuing to allow the emission of greenhouse gases will lead to the destruction of our state and society. The consequences of inaction are numerous, interlocking, and existential. To engage in allowing continued emissions by the merchant class therefore constitutes treason against the state: putting a private interest before the public interest to the extent of destroying the country” So here is our necessity. If the court that fails to see it, then they are culpable too. Our duty as citizens lies now not in obedience but in disobedience. As a mother of two young children, I have not taken this action lightly. I spent numerous nights wrestling with doubts, fears, worrying for my family and just gripped by my heartbeat. As I sat down in silence every day, listening to my deep motivations, everything slowly became clear. I am acting out of radical love. I am acting out of the deepest love for children, not just my own, and the intricate web of life of which humans are just a part. So much has been lost already. But there is so much more that we could lose. The time to act is Now. We are not the criminals.

      "Mayer Hillman in conversation with Extinction Rebellion activists Clare Farrell, La Pethick, Becky Plenderleith and Jill Lewis. Recorded in February 2021 Our guest Mayer Hillman was engaged in social science research at Policy Studies Institute from 1970, latterly as Senior Fellow Emeritus. Most recently, he has been attached to the University of Westminster ‑ in total, a period of over 50 years. Previous to that, he was, for 13 years, a British architect and town planner. He is a father and a grandfather. La Pethick is a grandmother and an arrestee from the south east coast She has five beloved grandchildren and believes she has a biological imperative to do all in her power to protect them and, therefore, all future generations from the effects of climate change, now and to come. She thinks we all need to be courageous in action, determined of mind and have love in our hearts. Jill Lewis is a grandmother from the south west who, as a member of the Ground Elders, helped secure Waterloo bridge in 2019. Bex Plenderleith is a mum of 3. Pre-children, she had few morals and worked as an advertising copywriter before giving that up to write jokes and silly books. Post-children, Bex raised lots of money as a community fund-raiser. After April 2019 and Waterloo Bridge, Bex had an avalanche of morals and now works full-time for Extinction Rebellion. Bex used to be very quiet. Not any more. Clare Farrell is not a parent and has no parents... is a co-founder of XR, which is a bit like having a massive chaotic family.\n",

      "We are Plastics Rebellion, a sister group within XR (like Ocean Rebellion or Animal Rebellion/ HS2 Rebellion) and we are united by an understanding of the colossal threat plastics pose and a desire to do something about it. That starts with spreading the word. And something we’re really passionate about spreading the word about is that RECYCLING DOESN’T WORK. Yes, you read that right, plastics recycling is NOT an answer and this zoom will tell you why. It will tell you how recycling somehow replaced ‘reduce’ and ‘reuse’ to become the main blocker to change on plastics pollution. How the plastics industry and it’s hot cousin, the fossil fuel industry, together with Government, misled us all about how much recycling could really do. And then, when they knew nobody could really recycle plastic, how in a revolting imperialistic initiative they decided to export it to other countries even less able to cope. Come along to face facts, meet like minded people as well as experts and industry insiders, and arm yourself with essential information. Speakers: Nina Shrank, Plastics Campaigner Greenpeace UK Dave Lane, Ex Local Government Sustainability Officer, now anti-recycling and XR member Nihan Temiz Ataz, Project Development Officer, Greenpeace Mediterranean NB sadly Nihan can’t join us as she has an emergency in her family.

They will describe the grim realities on the ground caused by fracking, mining, changing weather patterns and water privatization. They will also delve into the inequity at the heart of climate chaos and describe the great potential for changing this by coming together in international solidarity. Together we are calling for action to expose the hypocrisy of multinationals who present a green facade to customers in the global north all the while committing heinous environmental and human rights violations in the global south. Ina Maria Shikongo, an activist from Namibia will talk about the current droughts her country has been experiencing and why it is of utmost urgency to save the Okavango Basin, at risk of contamination and ecological catastrophe by Recon Africa’s oil and gas explorations. Mitzi Jonelle Tan is the international spokesperson for Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines (YACAP), the Fridays For Future (FFF) of the Philippines, and will bring out the interconnected issues of the climate and water crises and the funding of these in her country. Kambere Kavulikirwa, an environmental activist and scientist from the Democratic Republic of the Congo will discuss how it is that the basic human right of water is denied to so many in his home country and the role of supply chains in this. Esteban Servat (Ecoleaks), an Argentinian activist living in exile in Germany, will talk about fracking and mountain-top mining operations in Argentina and their impact on water contamination and scarcity, the role of Europe and the multinational companies, primarily from the Global North, that carry on with a colonialism for natural resources in the Global South which is fuelling the climate crisis and rendering useless many of the climate commitments of the Global North. Emilio Enriquez an activist with XR Mexico, will highlight the reality of water shortages in Northern Mexico and the devastating impact of international water trade deals between Mexico and the USA.

Reportage in a soul drenched poem of sound and vision montaged together from the within the Extinction Rebellion in London, October 2019.” “This film is utterly extraordinary. It distils the presence of the Red Rebels into a mysterious, otherworldly form. It speaks from a mythic place beyond the now and does so with such depth and authority that it demonstrates the artifice of contemporary life.

      "It should come as no surprise that this government has set out to delegitimise protestors when each protest pierces the bubble of complacency surrounding their climate record. This is the desperate act of a government in denial, to censor the voices of dissent rather than face the reality of the situation we are in.[1] Just two weeks ago the UNFCCC report showed that world leaders are completely neglecting their pledges to reach net zero – the UK included.[2] The UK government would like us to believe they are “world leaders on climate” but the reality is, like the pandemic, they have no real plan to get out of this crisis. Alanna Byrne of Extinction Rebellion, said: “What is the real issue here? At a time when the country is experiencing anger and frustration about an uncertain future, about racial inequality, about nurses on the front line who are being told to feel thankful they are employed, and environmental destruction, it’s not new police powers that we need but some compassionate leadership from the government. “Priti Patel can try and make the UK a protest free zone, but it’s clear that the government is not going to do the right thing without protestors holding them to account so we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. They can try to make it a crime to care but they will not stop people from caring.” So, they can label Extinction Rebellion, BLM and nurses on the front line as ‘aggravated activists’ all they like, but the suffragettes, civil rights movement and gay rights movement were all called similar things, all of whom have subsequently, despite their repression by the authorities, been found to be on the right side of history. Tim Crosland is an ex-Barrister with expertise in international human rights, environmental law and litigation, and an inter-disciplinary, partnership-based approach to tackling climate change. Tim is currently the director of Plan B who's aim is to support strategic legal action against climate change.

Extinction Rebellion was set up to tell the truth and the truth is that if we allow the carbon economy to get back up and running post covid ,we are locking in the suffering and death of billions of people. This is beyond the imagination but one thing is clear: that at this point, two years after the founding of XR, we have to enter into civil resistance against the government or become complicit in its murderous intent. Knowledge requires action. In this talk Cathy Eastburn will explore what XR has taught her, how she find strength to take part in ‘high stakes’ actions and how we can support each other in a regenerative way through this journey.

      "Creating a culture of openness and embodiment of movement values. Recorded on the 30 January 2021, over 500 people attended this public zoom meeting, showing a new move towards big XR online gatherings, creating greater openness and accountability. ''The stakes are high when people assemble now. The mark of citizenship in a strange time is the willingness to be sorrowed aloud, and to carry yourself as if the kids are watching, the not-yet-born kind. Not what’s in it for you: what’s asked of you. That’s what radicalized citizenship has become: The willingness to proceed as if what’s happening is happening. But translating that: that’s the poetry of now. That’s the goods. There will come a time when the current undoings will be undone, and those people in those times will be on the other side of us and our example. They’ll decide who we were, what we did, whether we bore them in mind at all. We could end up as the cautionary tale they’ll never want to be, or we could be a shard from an old chalice that has trace elements of a very fine wine, the rumour of a nobility that rose when the time came. We’ll continue to take from them, or we’ll leave some scent of ordinary courage in the teeth of an extraordinary storm, something they might yet believe in.

      "via Russia Today: Several (XR) climate activists were detained for occupying the UK energy department building (BEIS) in London on Monday, where they were protesting climate change and demanding that the government turn to renewable energy and stop fracking. Activists of the 'Extinction Rebellion' environmental group blocked the entrance of the building, with several among them inserting their arms into pipes and then gluing them to the ground, while others glued their hands directly to the building London police had to cut through the pipes with a surgical saw to remove the activist's arms from the doors of the Victoria Street building before detaining them. \"We are trying to spark a global international rebellion against the madness that has taken us towards extinction,\" climate activist Dr. Gail Bradbrook said. She added that many people believe climate change is something that occurs somewhere else, and said \"it's coming home to the western countries.\"\n",

      "‎‎November 2018 The Times: 'A ten-year-old girl has succeeded where thousands of adults failed by getting an oil company boss to listen to her plea about fossil fuels. More than 4,000 supporters of Extinction Rebellion, the environmental campaign group, blocked bridges over the Thames on Saturday to highlight a “climate emergency”. They caused traffic chaos but oil companies and the government largely ignored them. Elsie Luna tried a different tactic: she went to the London offices of several of the world’s biggest oil companies and politely asked the doormen if she could speak to the boss. After being turned away by Chevron, Total and ConocoPhillips, she tried Shell’s offices at Waterloo. Security refused to let her in so she started speaking to Shell employees as they left for lunch, challenging them about the company’s plans for oil and gas extraction despite its commitment to act on climate change. A few staff stopped and listened. After two hours Elsie and her mother Heather were invited in to meet Sinead Lynch, UK country chairwoman, and spent 20 minutes discussing the company’s response to climate change. Elsie, who is home-educated by her parents in Scunthorpe, said that she had told Ms Lynch that Shell was responsible for 1.67 per cent of global emissions and asked her “on behalf of the children in the world please, please declare a climate emergency, have a change of heart and keep your fossil fuels in the ground”. She said Ms Lynch had suggested that the world had until 2050 to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. “She was trying to greenwash me,” Elsie said. “I said ‘we have to get this done by 2025’. I bet we made her think.” Elsie was less successful at BP in St James’s Square. She had to make do with an eight-minute chat in the rain with Shannon Wiseman, a press officer, instead of meeting the chief executive Bob Dudley. Ms Wiseman listed various ways BP was trying to reduce its emissions, such as investing in onshore wind in the US and biofuels. Elsie replied: “Yes but when will you go fossil fuel free?” Ms Wisemen responded: “We don’t know that answer yet.” Elsie said: “If you don’t do that very soon, even humans will face extinction.” Elsie, who was Lincolnshire’s under nine female chess champion, was with her mother but spoke unprompted. A spokesman for Extinction Rebellion said it was planning to block roads in London today, tomorrow and Friday “to cause gridlock”. A report by WWF, the conservation charity, says it is technically possible for the UK to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050 and it should aim to do so by 2045.' original article:\n",

      "Re-posted from Extinction Rebellion Deutschland More information: Industrialised societies have long pursued the goal of making all possible areas economically viable in an exploitative manner. When animal and plant species are becoming extinct and ecosystems are collapsing, nature conservation is becoming more and more economically viable. Just as the climate movement demands climate justice, there needs to be justice in nature conservation. The example of national parks shows that without justice in nature conservation, indigenous people are driven from their areas or even killed. 80% of the worldwide diversity of all known living species is currently on the land of indigenous peoples, because they generally maintain regenerative lifestyles that do not pollute ecosystems. A system change in nature conservation is necessary. \"Solutions\" such as CO2 offsetting, \"Natural Climate Solutions\" or \"green capitalism\" projects won't save life on the planet. Especially if nothing is done to address over consumption in the global north and the industries and governments responsible for biodiversity loss. We are starting the campaign from the global north to reflect on responsibility and our thoughts and actions. The campaign aims to raise awareness that nature conservation, then and now, is often linked to racism and colonialism, and to identify solutions for equitable nature conservation that protects human rights and biodiversity at the same time.

      "Ready for some rebel magic there will be speakers Music performances to end A march that started at parliament Square. XR Fashion Action Piece of Cloth XR Fashion urges the fashion industry to end its relationship with fossil fuels and clean up its act. We are in the midst of a climate, ecological, and social emergency. Mass species extinction is already happening and human extinction is a real risk. If we are to survive, fashion must stop all extractivism and oil use. The fashion industry is also built on a long history of environmental and social exploitation throughout its supply chains, particularly of those in the Global South by those in the Global North. From fast-fashion to high end luxury, the fashion industry and its prevailing model rely heavily on the use of fossil-fuel-fibres. Since the early 2000s, fashion production has doubled - as has the use of polyester, which is now found in over half of textiles. Selfridges Group is owned by the Weston family, who also own Primark. Primark appeared as one of the worst contenders in the Changing Markets report 'Synthetics Anonymous: Fashion Brands' Addiction to Fossil Fuels, appearing in the red zone for 'transparency, use of synthetic fibres and commitments to phase them out'. Changing Markets Foundation found that it wasn't just fast fashion that relied the most on fossil fuels. The other brands in the red and yellow zones include Adidas, Nike, Puma, Burberry, and Calvin Klein, all of which are stocked in Selfridges. Global consumption of clothing and footwear is expected to increase by 63% by 2030, from 62 million tonnes in 2015 to 102 million in 2030. Synthetic fibres represent over two-thirds (69%) of all materials used by the apparel industry; that percentage is expected to reach nearly three-quarters by 2030. Due to their cheap costs, fossil fuel-derived fibres are a key enabler of the fast-fashion business model, and their production already requires more oil than the annual consumption of Spain. Fashion Action is a decentralised group of activists seeking to highlight the negative environmental and social impact of the fashion industry and to push for collaborative change.\n",

      "This film documents the arrest of Kate De La Mare-Valax during the Extinction Rebellion protests in London in October 2019. Kate is a Jersey Islander whose profound concerns about the climate and ecological crisis led her to travel from Jersey to participate in the XR protests. The edit of this film was commissioned by Jersey Heritage for the exhibition People! Power! Protest! and is currently on show at the Jersey Museum and Art Gallery. People! Power Protest! explores the story of protest in Jersey, from the Corn Riots of 1769 to the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. Jersey may be small but Islanders have made their voices heard loud and clear over the years. Jersey has a fascinating history of protest in the Island and the theme of the exhibition coincides with the 250th anniversary of the Code of Laws that was introduced in response to the Corn Riots. The exhibition explores how the right to protest has shaped and influenced the Island that we know today, from historic protests, such as the Corn Riots, to more recent protests such as Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter. The exhibition runs until Saturday 31st December 2022. Producer: Jo Syz\n",

G7 will need to increase their ambitions for emissions reduction and equitable climate finance, or risk the failure of not only COP26 but the entire Paris agreement.

      "LIVE: XR's GLOBAL MONEY REBELLION INCLUDING PROTEST AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND April 1st sees a wave of actions happening across the UK and the world - including Brussels, Paris and Melbourne - targeting the financial system and private and central banks in particular. We'll bring you live to several of these actions during the stream. TAKE DIGITAL ACTION FROM HOME: Or get involved phone jamming the Bank of England: This morning two XR Rebels - dressed as the 'Fossil Fools' who are recklessly endangering our future for profit - sprayed the Bank with fake oil. Meanwhile 'windows' depicting images of the impacts of the climate and ecological emergency were placed outside the building. The 'windows', created specifically for the action, symbolised a view into the impacts of the Bank's activities. This protest is part of a wave of actions by XR’s Money Rebellion designed to expose the role of banks in the climate and ecological crisis. The world's 60 largest banks have funded the fossil fuel industry to the tune of $3.8 trillion since 2016 [1]. The action today highlights the Bank of England's failure to regulate these banks and points to the fact that it still holds investments consistent with 3.5C of warming by the end of the century. [2] What drives this suicidal inaction is our economic system. Addicted to infinite GDP growth and ever-increasing profits for the rich, this system requires more burning of fossil fuels, more resource extraction, more deforestation and more consumption. The multiple crises that we face - climate change, inequality, overconsumption of the planet's resources - cannot be addressed without changing the system that drives them [3].

      "As part of the Rise Up For Change week (with Extinction Rebellion, Climate Strike Switzerland, Collective Climate Justice and Greenpeace Switzerland) in September 2020 in Bern, Switzerland, the Doctors for XR - Rebellion for Health – staged a happening to warn the population by comparing the elevation of temperature of the human body in relation to that of our planet and expressing their concern for their patients. N.B. This is a play and is not supposed to be scientifically exact, as it is to raise awareness. The number of 70 million internally displaced people is based on the 70 million displaced people in the world in 2018 and a big part of them can be attributed to climate change, even the ones generally attributed to wars or political instabilities, due to slow onset events , , ). As for the mention of +4° in 2050, it is an extrapolation based on the prediction of +7° in 2100 Nobody really knows what could be the temperature in 2050 if we do \"business as usual\", due to tipping points.

There have been successful experiments with new technologies but because they're currently less profitable manufacturers stick with Lithium. European, American, Dutch, or any nations' science funds should go to implementation and discovery of new battery technologies.

      "Next national day of action is 17th April. For more information: Action briefing: The UK government is overplaying its hand and attempting to outlaw the basic right to protest, threatening peaceful protestors with 10 year sentences at a time when we are faced with numerous intersecting crises.We have to ask why this Bill was being rushed through so fast? Democracy means allowing time for the conversation about how the Police, Crimes, Sentencing and Courts Bill will impact on everyone’s future forever. This is a moment in history where we need some deliberation not distraction, giving some serious thought to how this Bill will impact our democracy. When the politics of 2021 will decide the fate of the human species, we must also ask why a government trying to maintain a just, democratic society and take proportionate action on climate change wouldn’t welcome effective protest movements?Extinction Rebellion has a deep commitment to nonviolence. We use it as a means to reveal the true perpetrators of systemic violence that is waged against people every day the world over.We would urge the UK Government to look at recent history in the United States. We’ve seen what happens when a Government, instead of facing up to the current crises confronting society, attempts to silence dissent and stoke a “culture war”. When a Government, instead of healing society, sets out to sow division, it cannot claim innocence when the result is violence.

Cost of living, food insecurity, political instability, war, global, racial and societal inequality: it’s an old old story where the majority of us are forced to pay for crises not of our making, while a tiny minority profit from our struggle. The same government whose plan to tackle the climate crisis was recently found to be criminally inadequate, pours billions of taxpayers’ money into the fossil fuel industry each year, and has presided over a decline in conditions and real terms pay for people in many of the industries we rely on for our health, wellbeing, education and the basic infrastructure of our society.

      "Welcome to the Project 3.5 Report - regular short video reports with data, learnings and stories from on the ground with Project 3.5. What is Project 3.5? Watch the short explainer video here: The idea is a simple one: To build a movement that’s too big for the government and the fossil fuel industry to ignore, and to do it one door at a time. Project 3.5 is an Extinction Rebellion mobilisation campaign grounded in simple scalable tools - door knocking, public talks and follow-up phone calls. In consultation with experts from Momentum, The Social Practice and The Green New Deal, we are working to test our theory of change and mobilize 3.5 percent of the population towards nonviolent civil resistance - that’s roughly 2.3 million people in the UK. Already all around the UK local people are getting organised. It’s time to stop feeling powerless and alone in the face of the climate crisis and get to know other amazing local people who want to make a difference too.

      "With the Government announcing the UK's first national heat emergency, Clare Farrell was invited to BBC Newsnight. Extinction Rebellion's spokesperson Clare Farrell has mentioned the accountability crisis: The government haven't helped anybody to understand it and we have an abject accountability crisis. It's still okay for the banks to invest hundreds of billions. It's still okay for the government to fail on their targets. It's still okay for them to be found guilty, apparently in the High Court of having a totally, catastrophically poor plan that can't make it so.\n",

      "A UK-wide Summer Uprising kicked off in Cardiff, as rebels from across Wales and the South West set up stalls outside Cardiff Castle and marched to the Senedd. The day focused on demanding that UK and Welsh governments protect future generations by stopping new fossil fuels and guaranteeing a green and just transition for heavy industry workers. The public were able to pose questions to a climate change scientist and find out more about what Extinction Rebellion volunteers do. Other activities included cake and plant stalls, a free plant-based lunch, a kids’ area, and a print your own T-shirt stand, as well as entertainment from Rhythm Rebels, Extinction Rebellion’s samba band. At 3pm, the public was invited to join a march to the Senedd for a peaceful vigil, where candles were lit, and images of young people were held up to represent future generations. Extinction Rebellion Cymru says the Welsh Government is failing in six out of seven of its own wellbeing goals in the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. Whilst the goals are admirable, Welsh politicians continue to make poor decisions, which put future generations at risk, for example, by continuing to allow chicken farms to be built, despite the well-documented harmful impact they have on wildlife, rivers, drinking water, air and soil, and remaining silent on the extension of the Aberpergwm coal mine, despite signing the Glasgow Pact and joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance at COP26 last year. Extinction Rebellion Cymru will continue to hold those in power to account with planned protests and actions, as well as with inclusive, grassroots events and invite the public to get involved in their local group and take on one of the broad range of volunteer roles, including photography, banner making, action design or stewarding. The Summer Uprising continues around the UK during July and August and in September, Extinction Rebellion plans to bring millions to the streets of London in response to the Public Order Bill.\n",

      "Temperatures are reaching 40C in the UK. The Met Office issues, the first-ever red warning for extreme heat. After the government warnings on the heatwave, Jeremy Vine invited Clare Farrell from Extinction Rebellion and asked 'Are Climate Protestors Heroes?' Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, Clare Farrell, said: \"This heat that we are feeling now, I find utterly oppressive, mainly because I know that some of the changes that we have started in motion are irreversible. We're past the deadline for what needed to be done. We didn't start 30 years ago. We now need to deal with creating the least bad outcomes. \"It is not appropriate to look at somebody who is desperately calling out, especially young people [and] to turn and say well what about China, what about India. This is a world problem and we have to come together about it and work out how the whole global community can act. For that to take place you need leadership.\"\n",

      "On Sunday 10th July at 4.30pm, more than sixty Extinction Rebellion rebels from Wales and the South West of England gained access to the Aberpergwm mine site near Glynneath in South Wales, to highlight the Welsh Government’s silence on the decision to allow a licence to extract an additional 42 million tonnes of anthracite coal. The new licence, which will allow 100 million tonnes of CO2 and up to 1.17 million tonnes of methane to be generated, contravenes the Welsh Government’s own Wellbeing of Future Generations Act 2015, which requires public bodies in Wales to think about the long-term impact of their decisions. Furthermore, during COP26 last year, the Welsh Government signed the Glasgow Pact, which specifically mentions phasing out fossil fuels and joined the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. XR Cymru are calling on the First Minister Mark Drakeford and Minister for Climate Change, Julie James, to keep their promise and write to the Coal Authority stating their clear and urgent opposition to the expansion of the coal mine. To date, Welsh and UK Governments have pointed the finger of blame at each other, with neither taking responsibility nor trying to resolve the issue between them about which has the power to intervene. Since then, Coal Action Network, a campaigning organisation working for an end to coal use in power generation and steel production in the UK, has been granted a judicial review allowing it to test whether the Welsh Government can apply the Wales Act 2017 to the Aberpergwm coal mine expansion licence. The judicial review will also test whether the Coal Authority can consider factors beyond the narrow criteria it claims it's limited to when deciding a licence application.

      "National treasure, actor, author and comedian Stephen Fry called on the British public to support Extinction Rebellion. Speaking to camera Fry, said: “Reasonable people, I think, understand that something has to be done about fossil fuels, most of all about our insatiable appetite for them.” “It’s not good just saying everybody give up carbon use because we can’t - ultimately it’s up to governments. You need to get them to recognise that this is the most serious crisis that humanity has ever faced and that therefore we should plan, we should plan in a friendly way, in a way that involves all of humanity. \"Disruption can be an awful thing. It can ruin the way the world is. But there's another form of disruption, which is to stop the world going down the wrong path. To disrupt a destructive journey. And that's what Extinction Rebellion, for example, does.” Fry’s comments come as record breaking temperatures sweep across Europe increasing the risk of extensive forest fires this summer and deadly floods displace millions in Bangladesh. Earlier this month UN Secretary-General António Guterres called on world leaders to change course and end a “senseless and suicidal war against nature”, adding that fossil fuel companies and the banks that finance them “have humanity by the throat”. The video comes as Extinction Rebellion plans its next wave of actions open to the public to join beginning September 10th. Marly Lyman from Extinction Rebellion UK, said: “What the world needs now is a plan. We are in a moment of truth, and how we all respond will determine the next chapter of humanity. Because the crisis is here, it's in politics and on supermarket shelves, it's in the burning forests and our next pay cheque, it's in the communities facing flooding and our cultural institutions. The crisis is everywhere, and it's happening now. “Together we will stop the harm, ending fossil fuel use, excessive extraction, consumption and waste. We will repair nature – restoring biodiversity loss and protecting our only home. And to do it we must work together to build a new democracy that gives people a say. A shared dialogue that values and celebrates difference – a new model that is just and fair – built on love, care and kindness.” _________________________________________________________\n",

      "Concerned citizens from Money Rebellion are presenting a tableau of fossil-fuelled excess to HSBC management and shareholders filing into the bank’s Annual General Meeting at London’s South Bank Centre this morning. Members of the Extinction Rebellion group, which specifically targets financial institutions, toast their profits with champagne flutes filled with fake oil in front of a banner reading, ‘Dear future generations, please accept our apologies. We were rolling drunk on petroleum’, a quote by the author Kurt Vonnegut. Expect more non-violent mischief as the livestream progresses…but why? In 2021 alone, HSBC invested nearly $18 billion in the fossil fuel industry, and last May news leaked that HSBC had stakes in companies planning 73 new coal power plants. The multinational banking and financial services firm remains a major banker for Saudi Aramco and Exxonmobil, which are ranked first and fourth respectively in the Carbon Majors database of fossil fuel companies responsible for global carbon emissions since 1965. HSBC also owns equity stakes in five of the biggest Russian oil and gas companies – Gazprom, Rosneft, Tatneft, Lukoil and Novatek – helping to fund the invasion in Ukraine. This action comes following a stark warning from the UN Secretary General earlier this month that investment in new fossil fuels is ‘moral and economic madness’. Our message to HSBC’s stakeholders is clear: don’t be on the wrong side of history, funding the destruction of a liveable future: use your influence to drive the crucial transition towards a low-carbon economy!

Rebels blocked key entrances to the building and caused non-violent disruption inside and out, while Extinction Rebellion’s whistleblower arm, Truthteller, encouraged Shell executives to jump ship with a giant trampoline and personalised messages visible from the upper levels of the headquarters’ gleaming edifice. Shell is responsible for 2% of all CO2 and methane emissions since the mid 19th century. Last year Shell increased its profits to $19.3 billion, up from $4.8 billion the year before, mostly from an increase in gas prices that is now causing a cost of living crisis.

      "Over 60 Extinction Rebellion and Insurance Rebellion supporters have blocked the entrances to Lloyds of London’s headquarters this morning. Protesters used superglue, chains and bike locks to block over twenty-five entrances to the building, with the intention of closing business for the day. Climbers also scaled the outside of the iconic building and dropped two banners, saying 'End Fossil Fuels Now' and 'Insure Climate Justice', while protestors from XR’s whistleblower arm, Truth Teller, handing out leaflets to employees. Lloyd's of London, through its many syndicates, insures around 40% of the global energy market. Extinction Rebellion is demanding that Lloyd's of London stop insuring fossil fuels projects, in line with the International Energy Agency’s warning that, in order to avoid a global temperature rise of below 1.5C, all new fossil fuel projects should be halted as of last year. Lloyd’s is believed to be the underwriter for the controversial Canadian Trans Mountain Pipeline extension, which has been fiercely opposed by Indigenous communities whose land it cuts through, and would allow a dramatic increase in the amount of tar sands Canada could export, shipping 590,000 barrels per day of tar sands crude. This is only one of many of Lloyd’s projects that sacrifice Indigenous, Black, and brown communities on the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction and the climate crisis. Protesters also claim that Lloyd’s CEO, John Neal, is pursuing short-term profit over Lloyd’s long-term interest, after it was recently reported that he back-tracked on Lloyd's 2020 climate commitments.

The previous video in this series covers the March 2022 IPCC report on impacts and adaptation. There was a leak of this draft document last year, scientists have compared the two, and you can read their comments on the differences here: SPMs (Summary for Policymakers - an abridged version of the full report) like the one discussed in this film are often greatly criticised for allowing leaders off the hook.

      "The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report “a litany of broken climate promises” showing the world is “on a fast track to climate disaster.” Guterres noted that “climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals”, but, for him, “the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.” In a video message, he said the report “is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unlivable world.” According to the new publication, the planet is on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris. “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing – but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic,” said Guterres. “Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness. Such investments will soon be stranded assets – a blot on the landscape, and a blight on investment portfolios,” he warned.\n",

The climate crisis is happening now. We all know it, we all see it: in the words of the UN Secretary-General, ‘delay means death’. Our dependence on fossil fuels is funding violence and war - including in Ukraine. It’s causing increasing fuel poverty for everyday people while a handful of companies rake in shameful profits. Just months after hosting the COP26 climate summit, the UK Government is choosing to continue down this disastrous path without consulting the British people. We say, enough is enough - NOT IN OUR NAMES. We must halt all new fossil fuel extraction immediately in order to limit global temperature rise to the Paris Agreement's crucial 1.5℃ (International Energy Agency). And we’re putting our bodies on the line to make it happen. Civil resistance is beyond justified and we know it works, but we need you. Join us in central London on April 9th.

It’s worked throughout history and across the globe, and it will work again. It must.

But when was the last time you had a conversation about the crisis – the biggest threat to have ever faced humanity – with someone who reads a different newspaper to you? Let’s head out into our communities, knock on doors, and speak to everyone we can about the climate emergency with the invitation to rebel together, and while we’re at it – build the bonds that will see us through what’s to come.

      "The IPCC reports are written in really difficult, technical language that makes them almost impossible to understand. We filmed this discussion about the most recent report, with the help of Dr Charlie Gardner from XR Scientists, to draw out the meaning behind the technical language and explain what’s really going on. If you have friends and family who are not aware of the reports or do not understand their contents, please share this with them. We hope they might find this an easy-to-follow discussion. The recent report, published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (6th Assessment Report, Working Group 2) summarises all the climate science that’s been carried out around the world, combining it all into a single document, that can be used by anyone who wants to understand the many different ways that climate change is going to devastate everything if we don’t stop it. The focus of this one is adaptation - what we need to do if we’re going to survive the crisis with a minimum of loss, suffering, and death. We don't cover the entire content because the report itself is huge.

Barclays says they will reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement, and promises to spend an average of £8.3 billion per year on green finance up to 2030. However, in the four years after the Paris Agreement they spent more than double this funding fossil fuel companies (an average of £22 billion per year).

      "Commit to coming to the Rebellion: Extinction Rebellion UK responds to the failure of the COP process with plans to mobilise two million in the UK towards mass civil disobedience, with the first major campaign of civil resistance taking place in April 2022. The COP process has failed even by its own standards, the most important of which being limiting temperature increases to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels. The IPCC says that in order to avoid breaching 1.5˚C, global emissions need to fall by 45% by 2030. [1] Following COP26, according to the commitments made by the attending nations, the world is on track for a 16% increase in emissions by 2030. [2] COP26 failed to heed the calls of experts, including the IPCC Chair, Dr. Hoesung Lee, for \"immediate, rapid, global wide-ranging\" global emissions decline. In the words of the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa, COP26 leaves the human race continuing to “invest in our own extinction.” Nuala Gathercole Lam of Extinction Rebellion, said: “The tragic lack of action is not for a shortage of potential solutions to the climate crisis, but down to a lack of political will to make difficult changes that threaten powerful financial interests. For real progress to be made in future climate talks, one of the major polluting nations must step up and break the deadlock. “The theory behind Extinction Rebellion is that mass participation in civil disobedience - on the doorstep of the government, media and elites - is our best shot at creating the political conditions for the UK to step up and play that role.” Research carried out by Erica Chenowith, a political scientist at Harvard University, and Maria Stephan, a researcher at the International Centre for Nonviolent Conflict, found that over the course of the twentieth century movements which achieved active engagement of at least 3.5 percent of the population have never failed to bring about significant social and political change. [3] In the UK that is 2.3 million people. Following the large numbers Extinction Rebellion brought onto the streets in April and October 2019, the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 forced the movement towards smaller, more targeted, and by their nature more covid safe, actions. Now the civil disobedience group will return to its roots, rolling out a nationwide programme of door to door canvassing, talks, trainings and mass participation civil disobedience campaigns, with the aim of engaging 2.3 million people. Gathercole Lam added: “While our mass participation campaigns of April and October 2019 played a significant role in driving forward the recognition of the climate and ecological crisis - the UK parliament was the first to declare a climate emergency, our government was the first major economy to sign a net zero date into law and the British public have the highest levels of climate concern globally - XR’s actions have not yet brought about the real action on the part of government needed to reduce emissions and restore biodiversity. “That’s why in 2022 we will be working to grow our numbers and developing designs for civil resistance campaigns, the first of which will take place in April 2022. Our mobilisation programme will continue to build numbers through the year with the aim of achieving XR’s three demands. “The failure of COP26, and indeed the COP process generally, is devastating but not surprising - it is clearer than ever now that it's up to all of us.” [4] [5] The April date will be released in the New Year.

      "As of October 12 2023, the jury in the historic Treasury Fire Engine Trial has acquitted five of the six defendants of conspiracy to commit criminal damage to His Majesty’s Treasury building by a majority verdict at Southwark Crown Court. On 3 October 2019, Extinction Rebellion activists sprayed 1,800 litres of fake blood made of washable dye over the Treasury building from a decommissioned fire engine. The dramatic spectacle – which made the front pages around the world – drew attention to the Treasury’s funding of new fossil fuel projects abroad in direct contravention of the globally agreed mission to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C. The Treasury claimed the cost of the damage from the fake blood was nearly £20,000. Defendant Liam Norton said: “Today’s verdict was a victory for common sense and a victory against the Treasury who, as our action was designed to highlight, continued to fund fossil fuel projects abroad for five years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The Treasury continues to act criminally today by financing the development of new oil and gas fields in the North Sea including Rosebank. This ensures we can never keep within safe climate limits. This trial was never in the public interest. When will the Treasury be put on trial for criminal negligence?” Further to this video, the sixth defendant was also found Not Guilty.

      "Imagine a plan to make sure the interests of people and nature are taken into careful consideration in all decisions; where no one is left behind and we transition together to a healthier, fairer society. Extinction Rebellion UK rebels will be working in their local communities with their friends, neighbours, community groups, local charities, NGOs and campaign groups to run community assemblies to influence decision making on local issues. But there is more! Groups will be paying coordinated visits to their MPs to tell them about deliberative democracy and how we want them to take it to Westminster for us. Groups will be occupying councils unwilling to listen to the people and put the needs of the community over personal gain and profit. The vision is that over the next months, dozens of government authority buildings will be occupied all over the country with the simple demand to follow the recommendations of their local community assembly on important issues. And in the end, we will have build a strong, trusting, united movement consisting of many voices and many groups, that will take the streets once more to demand from Westminster that they finally commission a Citizens' Assembly on Climate and Ecological Justice to ensure we get the fair and urgent long-term solutions we need. --- The UK community of concerned climate conscious citizens who 'Rebel for Life'!.

      "MARCUS & MORGAN: REBEL FOR TRUTH One year ago, Morgan Trowland and Marcus Decker bravely scaled the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, for one of the most spectacular and successful banner drops in the history of protest. Taking action for Just Stop Oil, they boldly demanded the UK Government cease all consents and licenses for new fossil fuel projects. A demand which is increasingly being ignored as Sunak ramps up support for fossil fuels and overturns environmental protections. On October 20th 2022, they were imprisoned awaiting trial, which eventually came in April 2023 when they received sentences of 3 years for Morgan and 2 years 7 months for Marcus - some of the longest sentences ever passed for non-violent protestors in British history. REBELLION THROUGH CREATIVITY Marcus and Morgan are incredibly gifted, visionary people who blazed a trail in Extinction Rebellion, inspiring people to raise their voices through music, design and non-violent direct action. HEROES NOT CRIMINALS As if the prison sentence wasn’t bad enough, Marcus, a German citizen, is being threatened with deportation. You can show your solidarity for Marcus by signing the petition to stop his deportation: WE DEMAND FREEDOM FOR MORGAN AND MARCUS\n",

      "THE stark reality is that the Global North owes countries of the Global South $7.9 trillion annually due to the climate destruction wrecked upon them. That’s SIXTY FIVE TIMES more than the annual debt repayments of Global South countries. The alliance of many groups including Extinction Rebellion and Debt for Climate call for total debt cancellation for all Global South countries in need, this is vital and cancellation must be across all creditors and free from economic conditions.

      "LIVE! People in London are now joining thousands in actions across the UK and millions across the world this weekend as part of the Global Fight to End Fossil Fuels campaign - demanding that leaders rapidly phase out fossil fuels. They are calling out the government for seeking to ‘max out’ North Sea oil and gas reserves despite warnings that there can be no new drilling if the world is to stay within habitable climate limits. The UK government is giving out hundreds of new North Sea licences and has voiced its support for the proposed development of the huge Rosebank oil field off the Scottish coast. Over 40 UK demonstrations are happening this weekend, including in London, Edinburgh, Manchester and Plymouth. They follow a warning last week by the United Nations that the world will fail to stop the climate crisis unless fossil fuels are rapidly phased out. The UK is the second largest oil and gas producer in Europe and is part of a tiny club of Global North countries that are ramping up production while claiming to be leading on climate action. Just five countries – the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway, and the UK – are responsible for a majority (51%) of the CO2 pollution threatened by new oil and gas projects from now to 2050. This weekend will see over 400 anti-fossil fuel demonstrations take place around the world, from Cape Town to Tokyo, Karachi to New York, which will also play host to the UN Climate Ambition Summit on 20th September. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres is expected to call for countries to stop approving new oil and gas production at the New York summit. Rishi Sunak, who is set to miss the UN General Assembly happening the same week, is unlikely to attend.\n",

      "Rebels from XR Cymru/Wales and XR UK joined forces to shut down an illegal coal mine in South Wales. With determination and defiance, they locked themselves to the boat, disrupting the mining operation and demanding justice. For over 8 months, the Ffos-y-Fran colliery has operated without a license, mining nearly 300,000 tonnes of coal and releasing close to a million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. The authorities have failed to intervene, allowing this planet-wrecking operation to continue unabated. But we refuse to stand by while our suffers. We're here to challenge the inaction and make a bold statement: STOP EXTRACTING AND SHIPPING COAL IMMEDIATELY AND FOR GOOD! We are willing to put our liberty on the line because the government and police have failed to act. Join us in solidarity as we maintain the blockade day and night for at least a week, escalating our action this weekend. On July 8th, a peaceful mass march organised by No More Coal will converge on the mine with one message: NO MORE DESTRUCTION! ”We encourage hundreds, even thousands, of people to come from all over the country to march on Ffos-y-Fran to tell them that we, the people, say no more.” An enforcement notice is in effect, giving the mine owners 28 days to cease extraction. But if they appeal, the operations could continue for up to another year. We call on the local council and the Welsh Government to issue a \"stop\" notice and halt this illegal mining immediately. Together, we demand accountability. Join us in the fight for a sustainable future. Our voices will not be silenced!

      "👥 XR entered and disrupted the National Conservatism Conference in London, interrupting speakers and highlighting increasingly dangerous rhetoric from senior political figures. 🗣️ Peaceful protesters worked inside and outside the conference at the Emmanuel Centre in Westminster, to appeal directly to conference attendees and the public on the warning signs of fascism. 💬 The conference promotes the principles of national conservatism, which shows strong similarities with fascist ideals. Especially the dominant nationalist agenda. 🎤 Speakers include high-profile, right-wing members of the Government, including the Home Secretary Suella Braverman, and Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lee Anderson. 🚨 National conservatism sees the courts and police as the means of suppressing peaceful protest and criminalising asylum seekers and trade unionists. 🔍 Following the implementation of the controversial Public Order Act ahead of the King's coronation, there are concerns of increasingly fascist ideals being adopted by senior members of the Conservative Party. Even the UN has criticised the new law as \"incompatible with the UK’s international human rights obligations regarding people’s rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.\" In the build-up to the conference, some news outlets have highlighted its significance and how it could influence the future of Conservative Party leadership and, in turn, UK politics. 🌎 Previous attendees of the conference include political figures on the far-right, including: Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban; Republican Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis; Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni; with the final keynote speech previously given by Kevin Roberts, President of The Heritage Foundation - a stalwart of the US radical right.\n",

Your “Carbon Footprint” is not to blame. Climate change is caused by a handful of multinational fossil fuel corporations that are profiting from pumping astronomical amounts of pollution into our air. Those who are responsible should be held accountable. The UK Government have shown that they cannot be trusted to do the work, but the people are ready to roll up our sleeves and get it done. From April 21-24, The streets of Westminster will be transformed with People’s Pickets outside government departments and a diverse programme of speakers, performers and workshops, awash with colour and culture. There will be art and music, talks from experts, places to listen and engage, and activities for the kids.

Climate change is creating particular challenges for women and girls. From increased poverty and food insecurity to displacement and violence, women are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. But the insights of feminism can also help us to move forward, to think about what we need to put in place for a more sustainable world, and how to build the solidarity to get there. This event includes activists on climate justice and women's rights from Britain, South Africa and Uganda. It will explore how the climate crisis is already affecting women, and take forward the vital discussion on how we can work towards a more equal and greener future.

      "What should our children be learning to prepare them for the Jobs of the Future? Certainly, not pumping gas, flying aeroplanes. These are not compatible with a planet that can support life on earth. Does the UK education system teach the skills needed in tomorrow’s world, today? Our children need to prepare for their future careers. Train drivers, foresters, circular design, sustainable farmers, nutritionists - does the Government even have a clear strategy to develop our sustainable industries? We need our government and big business to get real about the peril we all face. The simple, fast way to slow the rate of planetary warming is to RADICALLY reduce emissions immediately and put a halt to new oil & gas extraction. Time has almost entirely run out to address the climate and ecological crisis which is upon us, including the 6th mass species extinction, global pollution, and increasingly rapid climate change. If urgent and radical action isn’t taken, we’re heading towards 4˚C warming, leading to societal collapse and mass loss of life. The younger generation, racially marginalised communities and the Global South are on the front-line. No-one will escape the devastating impacts.

      "The world’s leading climate scientists, convened by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released their latest assessment on the mitigation of climate change on 4 April 2022. The findings are alarming: despite all climate action to date, global emissions keep growing, and not a single country is yet doing enough. But that’s not the full story. In this video we focus on the good news: Solutions are here, and ready to be deployed, if governments give them a real chance, respecting the rights and needs of those with least responsibility and capability to act. Action will be needed to curb all greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on the critical decade between now and 2030. In this video, the CO2 reduction curve is highlighted, as CO2 is the gas that warms the climate the most, dominates the level of long-term warming and needs to reach net zero the fastest (by mid-century). The path for all greenhouse gases (GHG) would look very similar, albeit with varying assumptions on when and if net-zero is achieved.

In November last year, the world’s gaze focused on Glasgow at Cop26 as 'a historic, collective achievement' was forged between 200 countries – the Glasgow climate pact. Since then, unprecedented global events have threatened this commitment to limiting climate destruction, and the hopes of 'keeping 1.5 alive' have been dashed.

      "Is natural gas renewable? Is it a fossil fuel? A casual google search for natural gas gives the impression that these questions are somehow up for debate. And while natural gas has helped reduce carbon emissions as it was widely adopted as a replacement for coal, it is now up against zero-emission energy such as wind and solar. So how did natural gas end up in the same bracket as renewables? Josh Toussaint-Strauss explores the lengths fossil fuel companies have gone to in order to try to convince consumers, voters and lawmakers that natural gas is somehow a clean energy source.\n",

Countries and companies like BP can use the net zero emissions goals and targets to continue burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide, ultimately fueling the climate crisis, while they rely on the false promise of carbon capture and carbon sequestration techniques like tree planting or technologies that haven't even been invented yet. Essentially, net zero emissions schemes allow for a worsening of the climate crisis because they are a procrastination technique for countries and corporations who do not want to reduce their emissions.

Specifically, I look at how overfishing threatens fisheries fish populations. worldwide. Overfishing has already decimated Atlantic cod and bluefin tuna fisheries and threatens many more. Fishing as a practice has been a staple in many diets for thousands of years but it wasn't until the commodification of fish under capitalism and the heightened industrialization of the fishing trades that global fish population and stocks began to seriously plummet. With inventions like the bottom trawler and big net fishing, fisherfolk are able to catch copious amounts in comparably little time. Overfishing has been devasting to the rich biodiversity of the oceans, rendering some areas devoid of important fish species. So, while ocean plastic and ocean trash clean-up efforts like #teamseas are at least doing something, there is much more threatening our oceans than plastic.\n",

      "In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at how we end climate imperialism through climate debt. With COP 26 on our doorstep, it's more important than ever to talk about climate debt and climate imperialism. Climate debt is a concept developed to reveal the unequal relationship between Global North (the imperial core) and the Global South (the imperial periphery) caused by centuries of imperialism, colonialism, and climate change. Climate debt demands countries in the imperial core pay reparations for the damage they've done to people, atmosphere and planet. For countless COPs countries in the imperial periphery have pushed for repayment of climate debts, but have been rebuffed over and over. In part, this is why The World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth took place in Cochabamba in 2010. Indeed, the People's Agreement that came out of the Cochabamba People's Conference highlights climate debt as an essential tool in the fight to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis.\n",

      "In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I answer the question, can small-scale farming feed the world? Specifically, I look at how industrial farming and the green revolution have led to increased farming emissions and severely depleted soil health. Small-scale farming, which I define as regenerative farms employing traditional knowledge, crop diversity,  and low carbon tools, can not only feed the world but do so in a manner that mitigates and possibly reverses the effects of climate chaos and industrial agriculture. Small-scale farms also offer a place to build movement power. A refuge to build people power and transform our current untenable capitalist system. Small-scale farming can mean big change.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why these tipping points are code red for our planet and how the climate crisis and capitalism are driving us closer to the edge. Specifically, I look at climate tipping points like the Amazon rainforest dieback and the melting of the permafrost in order to grasp what exactly is at stake if we don't act now on climate change and the climate crisis. The Amazon rainforest dieback tipping point is currently being driven by Amazon rainforest deforestation and climate change-driven extreme heat. and wildfires. If left unchecked, climate change and deforestation could mean an irreversible die-off of the Amazon rainforest. Another tipping point of consequence is the melting of the permafrost. Permafrost melt creates a positive feedback look and could potentially release hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 and methane into the air, further warming the climate. Tipping points then show us that action needs to be taken right now or else irreversible consequences will soon arrive.\n",

While the United States has promised substantial. emissions cuts, they are too slow and too late. The United States' imperialist endeavors abroad have also worked to destabilize regions and prevent resilience in the face of climate change. From protecting oil fields and fossil fuel interests in the Gulf and Iraq Wars to various attempted coups, United States imperialism has made it that much harder to deal with climate change. In addition, United States-backed sanctions have also dealt crushing blows to countries try to build resilience in the face of COVID-19 and the climate crisis. In short, driven by profit and territorial expansion, the United States is not only causing climate change but also making it worse for those on the frontlines.\n",

Elon Musk won't save us because companies like Tesla are exploiting workers in Tesla factories, as well as utilizing capitalist, colonialist methods of extraction that rely on child labor in cobalt and lithium mines. Elon Musk's future is one where the ruling class enjoys the luxuries of his companies like the Tesla Cybertruck or the Las Vegas Loop System, or even a martian space colony, all at the expense of laborers and the working class. Elon Musk shows that ecomodernism is an untenable solution to the climate crisis and climate change.

      "In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why the American lawn must die. Specifically, I look at the grass lawn's history of class exploitation and settler colonialism and how that ties into the American lawn culture we see today. The lawn began in Europe as an elite status symbol that was tended and mowed by peasants freshly forced into wage labor through the enclosure of the commons. The turfgrass lawn was then exported to colonial America where it was used as a tool to terraform indigenous land. And in the post-WWII suburban boom, the lawn soon became a symbol of white conformity. The turfgrass lawn though has a huge environmental impact. It's the biggest crop in the United States by area and requires a massive amount of fossil fuels, fertilizer, and chemicals to upkeep. Even if you don't want to tend to your lawn, some towns require you, with the threat of jail time to mow the grass. Ultimately, the grass lawn is a tool of capitalist settler colonialism that is exacerbating climate change and the climate crisis.\n",

Specifically, I unpack how degrowth and ecosocialism can work in tandem to stop consumerism and overconsumption and reduce emissions in order to transition to a zero-carbon, post-climate change world. Degrowth is a response to the rampant growth/profit capitalist paradigm that fuels consumerism and is causing climate change. Degrowth de-centers capitalism and consumerism and instead argues for a world wherein there's a planned contraction of rich economies to allow for the well-being of everyone in the world. Degrowth, however, can't function well without ecosocialism. Ecosocialism recognizes that the climate crisis is a capitalist crisis and vice versa. In order for degrowth to work it needs to incorporate full democratic control of the means of production and the state in order to avoid draconian measures of austerity. Degrowth and ecosocialism represent an end to consumerism and overconsumption.\n",

      "In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at an aspect of plastic pollution that often is ignored in the face of plastic pollution in the ocean. While ocean plastic pollution is an important issue, plastic is actually a fossil fuel production. This means that the emissions from plastic creation are massive. Unfortunately, the fossil fuel industry sees plastic as a plan B in the face of a renewables transition. This means that plastic pollution in the ocean and the atmosphere will only rise as fossil fuel industries seek to cover their losses. Unfortunately, recycling plastic is not a viable solution. Recycling plastic is actually an industry-backed tool to get people to buy more plastic without actually recycling most of the plastic, leading to lots of plastic pollution. At the end of the day, only bans and a transition away from plastic can halt plastic pollution both in terms of emissions and ocean plastic pollution.\n",

Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are not viable solutions to the current financial system because cryptocurrency's blockchain proof-of-work model requires a massive amount of electricity consumption. Essentially Bitcoin miners or other miners of cryptocurrencies use specialized computers to solve math problems and the end result is more Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. This process of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining, however, is environmentally destructive and unsustainable because it demands a huge amount of energy. There are some potential solutions to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency's energy and environmental cost. Switching to a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency model could drastically reduce cryptocurrency's environmental harms.

In short overpopulation and environmental destruction as a result of overpopulation were wielded as racist and white supremacist tools to oppress people of color, especially in the majority world.

Through this carbon footprint video, Rollie reveals how and why the BP oil created the idea of the carbon footprint. Over the course of multiple decades, BP used the idea of a carbon footprint to push the responsibility and the burden of carbon emissions onto the individual and away from their own practices. Essentially BP created the carbon footprint as an elaborate victim-blaming scheme. Your carbon footprint matters, but the reason why you have a carbon footprint in the first place is that fossil fuel companies like BP have fought tooth and nail against any kind of transition away from oil and gas.\n",

It is through their control and power over production that the rich drive emissions through the roof in pursuit of profits. In order to understand the climate crisis, in order to understand what's driving the climate crisis, we need to look beyond individual footprints and toward the point of production.

      "In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at ways in which we can build a Solarpunk future right now. Solarpunk envisions a world in which nature and humanity are seamlessly intertwined, and it does this through a combination of low and high-tech stools as well as political ideologies that center on justice and the environment. Solarpunk solutions might look like Earthships which are already being constructed around the world with hand tools and human ingenuity. Earthships employ many principles of design that lend well to a Solarpunk world. Earthships are generally made from recycled materials and are rammed full of packed dirt local to the area. The Earthship takes advantage of the sun and the wind through passive heating and cooling as well as solar panels, it collects rainwater, and incorporates nature into the house through indoor greenhouses that connect the Earthship dweller with nature as well as provide resilience. There are also Solarpunk solutions readily available right now for transportation. That comes in the form of sailing in the form 21st century. Sailing is a Solarpunk solution because its ties our economy and our materials to the rhythms of the sea and of nature. Ultimately Solarpunk envisions a world that might be slower, but more intentional. One that ties humanity closely to the natural world. Luckily we already have many Solarpunk tools to create that future at our disposal today.\n",

My question, however, is whether completely replacing gas cars with electric cars is a justice-oriented answer to the climate crisis.

Unfortunately, imperial core countries like the United States have started building walls to keep people out instead of building bridges to help people escape the storm that the imperial core is largely to blame for. Militarized borders will only make the climate refugee crisis worse, so it's no wonder that the ties between private border security contractors and fossil fuel companies are intimate.

      "In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why eco-modernism is not not only not a solution to the climate crisis, but also could create a capitalist climate disaster.  Eco-modernism, at its core, is a capitalist philosophy that seeks to escape climate change and environmental destruction through technological innovation, agricultural intensification, and city densification. Elon Musk and Bill Gates are perfect examples of eco-modernist. Both seek to harness current, and more importantly, future technologies like carbon capture and next-generation nuclear reactors to decouple emissions from economic growth. Ultimately eco-modernism seeks to maintain business-as-usual capitalism by relying on untested technologies and unproven theories.\n",

Specifically, I dive into the capitalist commodification of food, and how most of the industrialized farming that takes place in the imperial core doesn't produce crops for our consumption. Instead, the majority of the \"food\" we grow goes toward animal feed and biofuels. In addition, the fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides that our current industrialized farming system gobbles up are derived from fossil fuels. Essentially, fossil fuel corporations are laundering their dirty fuels through the very chemicals farmers use to grow their crops. Our food system is broken. We're in desperate need of a new agro-ecological revolution.\n",

We have been told you should only disrupt the government and business. Wrong. Society in a democracy belongs it's public and the public is responsible for society. Public disruption at the end of the world is the only way a society can transform itself - through rage, then dialogue and then collective resolution.

      "This short 25 min film offers an introduction to nonviolence using a street-ready definition that shows how nonviolence is active including an element of confrontation but without violence. Nonviolence is often confused with not-being-violent which is passive and ineffective. Nonviolence upholds higher values which accrue to it with a gravitational pull. The film places nonviolence in the wider, bigger picture of social movements and explains why nonviolence cannot co-exist alongside violence or excessive tension; nonviolence falls back to the default and ineffective not-being-violent when used in a strategy of \"diversity of tactics\". JSO would like to acknowledge and thank Extinction Rebellion's Embedding Nonviolence team for this film and we apologise for using it without asking in order to protect you from possible legal consequences.

David Spratt is research director for the Melbourne-based Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration and co-author of the book Climate Code Red: The Case for Emergency Action, David will talk about the reticence of scientists. Why, for 30 years, they have failed to communicate in plain language what it means for the climate to breakdown. Jason Box is professor and ice climatologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. He is one of the most outspoken scientists in the world today.

Adam McKay, like billions of other people on this planet, could not be more freaked out. Why the fuck is nothing happening?

      "Recorded on the 13 July 2023 with speakers: Sharan Dhaliwal ) Peter Tatchell Katlego K Kolanyane-Kesupile In a world of climate collapse, who do you think will be the first to suffer? Those who are marginalised are those who suffer the most from social collapse, yet in any space of change you find LGBTQIA+ folx, ethnic minority groups, and women. In urgent times of environmental collapse, it is essential to unite all movements fighting for our futures. Here, we explore the intersectionality between queerness and environmentalism / climate justice, and how this is changing the world. In this talk we dive into the power and pride of intersecting queer liberation with climate justice, and what true queer environmental allyship really is. We are outraged that spaces allegedly promoting queer pride are getting into bed with (and being rainbow / greenwashed by) environmental killers and fossil fuel giants like Shell, BP, and HSBC. Queerness has always been at the forefront of social justice, as it embraces diversity and pushes for society to move forward.However, the past two years across the US and UK have seen an onslaught of anti-LGBTQ+ bills being introduced in legislatures. In the UK, it is estimated that 24% of the young person homeless population identify as LGBTQIA+, with the figure reaching 40% in the United States.

It would be reached at an actual temperature of 45°C if relative humidity were 50%, or at about 39°C if humidity were 75%. Beyond this point it becomes impossible for sweat to cool the body down, causing people to overheat and in effect cook. Cells swell, proteins are deformed and organ systems fail, resulting in death. At wet-bulb temperatures above 35°C, it is thought that even young healthy people wearing light clothing—regardless of whether they are parked in front of a fan, in the shade or have unlimited water to drink—will die in about six hours.'

Their crime? Attempting to quietly hold a sign in protest as the royal procession passed by on The Mall and Whitehall. Instead, they were searched, handcuffed, and dragged away to spend a night in the cells. While this is deeply shocking and upsetting, we have to look at the big picture. Only governments that have lost the support of the public resort to crackdowns on protest; local election results show that the Tory party is on the edge of total collapse. \n",

But it’s 2023, and we are barrelling down the highway to the loss of ordered civil society, as extreme weather impacts tens of millions, as our country becomes unrecognisable there is now a need to face reality. It is time to escalate, from disobedience into civil resistance - this is what the nurses and paramedics are doing. They are on the frontline of the harm being wreaked on us and have said no more. We stand with them, with those so impoverished they can no longer heat their homes and feed their families, we stand with those facing imprisonment and fines for demanding protection. There is no impunity from the coming storm, no free pass for the public.

We must prevent people from being forced out of their homelands by climate breakdown, while also protecting their right to move safely and with dignity.

      "This evening conference (Palace of Westminster - Houses of Parliament) was organised by Green House Think Tank and focused on the new potentialities for climate activism which may have been created by Extinction Rebellion (XR) and the school strikes, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic experience and the cost-of-living crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine. It asked whether this situation offers an unprecedented moment of confluence and the chance for a major transformative re-set. Speakers included Rupert Read, well-known philosopher, activist and author of Why Climate Breakdown Matters, and John Foster, author of Realism and the Climate Crisis. Discussants were Kevin Anderson, climate scientist, author and activist, and Molly Scott-Cato, Professor of economics and former Green Party MEP. The event was chaired by Zoe Williams from The Guardian. Baroness Jenny Jones brought the event to a close with some words. Presentations and discussion initially foregrounded the idea of the ‘moderate flank’ – the notion that the activities of XR and the school climate strikers, while failing to mobilise enough of the civil population to force radical action on government, have shifted the terrain of debate, the so-called ‘Overton window’. They have arguably brought assumptions into the mainstream which would have been unacceptably radical only a few years ago: that there really is a climate emergency, that the science really is unchallengeable except by vested interests, and that net zero really must be on the policy agenda for some not impossibly future date. From this, if true, it would follow that individuals and institutions comfortable only with comparatively mainstream forms of action could now remain within their comfort zones while genuinely engaging with the climate crisis. It might also be that these forms of action could have significantly more leverage than previously. This would mean in turn that we could at last envisage a diverse mainstream, and perhaps even a mass, movement of climate action. But is it true? Has the window shifted enough to provide an escape hatch from consumerist habits driving chronic emergency? And do the pandemic experience and the cost-of-living crisis make such hopes more or less plausible? The conference probed these claims, expectations, questions and possibilities.\n",

      "Originally posted at: --- Today we will dialogue with Rupert Read, one of the founders and spokespeople of Extinction Rebellion, who participated in the 26th annual Conference of Parties Nov 1 -12, 2021 in Glasgow. The COP completely failed to address the fact that we are now in what the UN Secretary General calls “Code Red for Humanity.” We are in the climate tipping point and so far and so far our governments have done next to nothing, choosing instead to massively exploit nature, wantonly develop fossil fuels, and persecute and murder climate activists, over 300 killed since 2006. In the face of this, Extinction Rebellion arose in 2018 as a global protest using direct action and civil disobedience to call attention to the climate crisis. Rupert Read was there and involved in the direct action in London. Rupert Read is an academic and Green Party campaigner. He has authored many books, including Facing Up to the Climate Reality and This Civilization is Finished. He teaches at East Anglia University and continues to be active in developing the precautionary principle with regard to the environment and in transformative adaptation, which he believes is essential in navigating through the climate emergency.

      "This pair of playlets, written by Kate Webster, based on scenarios taken from Rupert Read's book 'This Civilisation Is Finished' [we worked together on developing the concept of the paired playlets] lays out two alternative futures: One in which popular mobilisation after CoP26 led us in the direction of a challenging but manageable future. The other in which business as usual at CoPs led us in the direction of ... well, of escalating climate chaos and collapse. The first scenario is one of transformative adaptation enacted. The second scenario is one of civilisational decline. They feature the same basic characters and set-up, living in different futures, based on what they and many others did or didn’t do beginning in the early 2020s. Watching these two back-to-back playlets now, in late 2022, is bitter-sweet. One is forced to acknowledge that the path we are on is already trending slightly closer to the second than to the first scenario. But even this has an upside: it makes it more urgent to take up the pathway of transformative adaptation. Given that we are off the cliff, we can grasp more deeply the necessity for this. We can heed the call to do it… Goto (or ) for more. Thanks for watching (and sharing) “Good CoP, Bad CoP”. About Kate Webster\n",

Changes in climate that get recorded in the ice tell a story that we can’t see with our own eyes.” These are the words of ice core scientist Dr. Alison Criscitiello, speaking on the Pemberton Icefield in British Columbia with big wave surfer Greg Long and snowboarder Taylor Godber, both Parley ambassadors. Last year, the trio embarked on a three-person expedition out into the Canadian wilderness with the purpose of reconnecting with nature and absorbing the ancient information that’s often right in front of us. The team traversed across the wild terrain and into ice caves, to shed light on how the planet’s ecosystems are interconnected, from the glacial fields of Canada to the kelp forests of Scotland. We documented their mission for a stunning new Talisker x Parley film called The Stories The Ice Holds\n",

      "Zumwalt Acres is a regenerative agriculture community working to develop a model of land stewardship in Illinois that is ecologically sustainable and socially responsible, rooted in Jewish values. After close to 60 years of industrial row crops, they are working to transition the Zumwalt family farm to regenerative agriculture focused on agroforestry. Agroforestry is a way of utilizing trees and other perennial crops to grow food. They are transitioning 20 acres of corn/soy fields to organic alley cropping, restoring 30 acres of woodland area to forest farming and native hardwood forest, and growing vegetables. As they clear dead trees, they utilize the wood to produce biochar which is then mixed with compost and applied to our soil. Biochar reduces greenhouse gases and increases soil health. They are conducting field-based studies with biochar and basalt rock dust to better understand how these practices can best be used to mitigate climate change and grow healthy food.\n",

      "The Gulf Coast is quickly shaping up to be a central point of the Liquified Natural Gas, LNG, industry. This poses serious health risks to surrounding communities. There are currently five operating LNG facilities in the area and four more currently under construction. The facilities are largely being placed in low-income and predominantly Black and Brown neighborhoods. A trend is apparent in all the fossil fuel facilities in the region and country. Living near these facilities exposes people to toxins which increase the risk of cancer, heart, lung, and brain damage and disease. Because the area's fossil fuel facilities are built to sacrifice the health of already vulnerable communities, they have been named \"sacrifice zones.\" ⁠\n",

Many of these expeditions have positively impacted the sea and helped to make sustainable and ethical decisions to ensure that the sea is taken care of.\n",

      "We are excited to share our next \"Behind The Greens\" episode with you - RENATURE MONCHIQUE! This conservation project program has been planting trees since 2018 to reforest and restore the Monchique region after extreme and devastating wildfires. We spent a week with the team of GEOTA, learning about plantations, native species of trees in woodland, the challenges associated with tree planting, nature regeneration after forest fires, which are caused by global warming and climate change, and of course planting as many trees as we possibly could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone is talking about how we need to plant more trees, but not many people are talking about the importance of doing it right and keeping the trees alive. I was very curious about the topic of reforestation and replanting trees for years. The reality is that there are so many organizations that plant trees, that claim they can offset your emissions, but what actually goes into this process? How to understand what happens to the vegetation that you, or they plant? Do they only plant trees? Or do they actually grow them? How much they care about ecology? How it can revive and protect the nature after burned forest? We brought our team to South of Portugal to make movie film of the process of reforestation the area after one of the biggest Portuguese fires in history, to speak to ecologists and locals about the impact that a real tree planting and carbon offsetting project can have on local environment.\n",

While eating junk food can definitely affect your health, several studies has linked eating comfort food with reducing loneliness and anxiety.

I believe that a title environmentalist does not have to be limiting and restrictive, you literally can be whoever you want to be and have your reason and opinion for doing certain things. I also believe that only mass brands, like McDonald's - can change the world. Yes, niche brands can change certain products for certain people, but not in the scale that is need for a real change. And I am a strong believer that environmentalism comes in all shapes and forms, and it goes beyond veganism.\n",

Kabay Tamu, a Torres Strait Islander, is one of the 8 people suing the Australian government. Tamu has seen firsthand the effects of the climate crisis and the impacts it is having on his community’s health. The Torres Strait Islands are a group of small islands situated between the northern tip of Australia and the island of New Guinea. Kabay, who is also a member of the Torres Strait Island Regional Council’s Climate Change Adaptation & Environment Committee, says the situation is urgent. Dr. Ari Bernstein is a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital and director of the Center for Climate Health & the Global Environment at Harvard’s TH Chan School of Public Health. He says the difficulties Tamu is speaking about all have an effect on health. As the climate crisis worsens and more and more frontline communities are forced to adapt, mental health and physical health will be severely impacted, and children will bear a large part of the burden. Kabay says if Torres Strait Islanders have to leave their ancestral lands due to the climate crisis, the identity of the Indigenous communities that live on the islands will be lost.

      "This company is turning ruined wine into vodka after the grapes were smoke-damaged during California wildfires. Napa Valley, California is known for its wine production but some of the worst fire seasons ever recorded are threatening the vineyards and making many of the grapes unusable. Even if the fire doesn’t reach the actual grapevines, the smoke can get inside the fruit, affecting its chemistry and taste. This can lead to \"ashtray\" aromas from the resulting wines. When Nicolas Quille, the Chief Winemaking and Operations Officer for Crimson Wine Group, found that the wine he made from grapes affected by the 2020 fires was unusable, he decided to partner with Hangar 1 Vodka. The distiller turned his wine into a vodka, which they call Smoke Point. The proceeds from the vodka sales go to the California Fire Foundation, which provides assistance to firefighters, their families, and their communities. California experienced its worst wildfire years ever recorded in 2020, burning more than 4 million acres and the 2021 season has already destroyed more than 3 million acres of the state. Scientists attribute this to the historic drought that California is experiencing, paired with excessive heat, that is tied to climate change. Vodka \n",

      "'They tend not to listen to morality, but they do listen to money’ — Here’s how you can keep your money from funding the fossil fuel industry. Tara Houska is a Couchiching First Nation citizen, tribal attorney, and founder of Giniw Collective, an Indigenous women, 2-spirit led frontline movement to protect the Earth against gas and oil pipelines like Line 3 and Dakota Access. She says getting financial institutions to divest from fossil fuels is a potent form of climate activism. Houska says everyday citizens can keep their money from going to fossil fuel investments by carefully choosing where to put their own investments. Another way to make sure your money isn’t going to fossil fuel companies is by investing in clean energy for your home and community. Shifting your bank accounts and credit cards away from institutions that invest in fossil fuels can also be an effective method of getting corporations to divest. Houska says a large part of the problem with the fossil fuel industry, and in turn, the institutions that invest in said industry, is that they view the land as a resource. Houska often hears from corporations that climate change mitigation practices are expensive and how activists have to ‘think about the economy.’ She says they fail to see the proverbial forest through the trees.

      "Starbucks and Burger King received 5 stars for plant-based menu options — see which fast food chains ranked the lowest. World Animal Protection (WAP) released a scorecard in Oct 2021 giving star ratings to the U.S.’s top 50 fast-food chains to rank their adoption of plant-based menu items. Only 7 companies topped the list with 5 stars: Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Taco Bell, KFC, Chipotle, and Panera. Baskin Robbins was the only chain awarded 4 stars for having diversified protein options and moving in the right direction. Moe’s Southwest Grille and El Pollo Loco both received 3 stars due to making progress in adding plant-based menu options, but not quite enough and Dunkin’, formerly Dunkin’ Donuts, received 2 stars because it is failing to make progress and lacks nationwide options. All the remaining 35 fast-food chains received 1-star ratings including McDonald’s, Subway, Wendy’s, and Popeye’s. WAP says these chains do not meet expectations for plant-based proteins and show a lack of commitment to meat reduction. Cameron Harsh, the U.S. Programs Director for WAP, says that while adding plant-based menu items is important, fast-food chains also need to cut down their use of meat-based proteins. Harsh says that we don’t necessarily need to cut meat out entirely, but a switch to plant-based protein is becoming a necessity for planetary health.

      "Real tree vs. fake tree — here's how buying a real Christmas tree can help the environment. According to The Nature Conservancy, 400 million Christmas trees are grown on tree farms across the country, and only 10% are cut down annually. For every tree that is cut down 1 to 3 seedlings are planted, taking an average of 10 years to grow, according to the National Christmas Tree Association. Real trees provide clean air and water, as well as capture and store carbon, which helps lower greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Buying a real tree also supports local businesses, each tree purchase gives landowners the profits needed to keep their land forested, and keeps a healthy forest habitat for wildlife to survive. But most importantly, real trees can be recycled into mulch. Some farms even sell trees with root balls intact so they can be replanted after the holiday. Artificial trees are not easily recyclable, nor biodegradable, and even though they can be used for multiple years they eventually end up in local landfills. Which will you purchase this holiday season? Christmas \n",

Oil and gas are being spilled into Nigeria’s delta, causing massive destruction and it’s been going on for weeks. The Santa Barbara wellhead has been pumping oil and gas through the waterways of Nembe, Bayelsa State since it exploded on November 5. Weeks later, the wellhead was still spewing oil. Nobody has been able to get close enough to the wellhead to see what caused the explosion. Clean up teams have begun trying to shut the well down, and it’s unclear how much oil was spilled. The company that owns the wellhead, Nigeria-based Aiteo Eastern E&P, along with Nigeria’s petroleum minister and its president have all promised to clean up the spill. The delta has been repeatedly polluted by oil spills and energy exploration because of this, the communities surrounding it are struggling. Nigeria \n",

      "This father-son duo hopes to bring back woolly mammoths to help slow permafrost melt in the Arctic. Scientist Sergey Zimov ignored orders to leave the arctic after the Soviet Union collapsed and instead found funding to continue his research at the Northeast Science Station. He and his son, Nikita Zimov, are trying to slow down the rate of permafrost melt by bringing large herbivores to the Pleistocene Park nature reserve. They’ve even said mammoths could live there if other scientists can manage to bring them back. The large animals trample snow underfoot, removing its blanket-like insulation and allowing the soil underneath to get colder in the winter. Research published in the journal Scientific Reports shows the approx. 200 species of animals brought to the park have dropped the ground temperature by 1.9°C, with even larger swings in the winter and spring. While more research is needed to determine if this method is feasible across the Arctic, the paper said that introducing large animals could keep 37% of Arctic permafrost frozen. Researchers believe that thawing permafrost in Siberia could release the same amount, or more, greenhouse gasses compared to the EU’s industrial emissions. The frozen soil holds organic matter, which decomposes as it thaws and releases emissions such as CO2 and methane. Researchers say that Yakutia, the area surrounding Pleistocene Park, has warmed almost 3°C in the past 100 years. The rest of the world has warmed an average 1°C during that time. As the permafrost melts, infrastructure in Siberia is sinking and is expected to cost Russia $100 billion by 2050. Arctic \n",

      "BULL-ieve it or not, cow burps are causing big problems for global warming — so scientists are turning to seaweed for a solution to reduce methane from cattle farming. Scientists in Ireland are scrubbing the country’s coastline for seaweed to feed ruminant livestock such as cattle and sheep. Research out of University of California, Davis, found that adding a type of seaweed called asparagopsis taxiformis to cattle feed reduced the amount of methane released by the cows by an astonishing 82%. Methane, while shorter-lived than other greenhouse gases, warms the planet 30x more efficiently than CO2. In the U.S. approx 10% of methane emissions come from agriculture, a good portion of which is methane from cattle belches and flatulence. Researchers in Ireland are doubtful they can see an 80%+ reduction, but they still believe they could make a significant dent. Meanwhile, Ireland’s cattle numbers have reportedly grown by more than 10% over the last 10 years and the country is one of the largest beef and dairy exporters in Europe, Ireland’s per capita methane output is reportedly the highest in the European Union.

      "We’re at risk of releasing a generation’s worth of carbon into the atmosphere — here’s how protecting irrecoverable carbon will help avert climate catastrophe. » More from Conservation International: We are at risk of releasing a generation’s worth of carbon into the atmosphere. But what is irrecoverable carbon? And what can be done to avoid climate catastrophe? Earth is in the midst of a climate crisis, but some areas cannot afford to be eliminated. When landscapes are destroyed, vast stores of carbon are released into the atmosphere’ speeding up climate change. If released, some of that carbon may not be recovered in time for the world to prevent global warming above 2 °C. Which is why those stores are known as irrecoverable carbon. A new study released by Conservation International maps the places that must be protected to avoid runaway climate change. The map prioritizes the global 30 x 30 effort to protect 30% of the Earth’s land and waters by 2030. The map also shows how much irrecoverable carbon exists within already protected and indigenous lands. Which is one reason those communities need to be part of the conversation. In the last decade, agriculture, logging, and wildfires have released at least 4 Gt of irrecoverable carbon, equal to 5% of human-caused fossil fuel emission. According to researchers, we have 10 years to cut emissions in half and protect the carbon stocks in most of these ecosystems. Investing in irrecoverable carbon reserves can help improve the health of our climate, Earth's species, and the health of humanity. Conservation \n",

      "Investments in clean technology, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and more — here are a few ways the Build Back Better Act aims to fight the climate crisis. The Build Back Better Act would tackle the climate crisis in 3 major ways: 1) Lowering emissions 2) Major investments in clean technology 3) Environmental justice No country has emitted more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the U.S. The Biden admin has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. The Build Back Better Act would support this goal by removing incentives for fossil fuel & chemical production. It would bring back Superfund taxes, reduce international subsidies for oil and gas, impose new restrictions on offshore drilling, and require oil & gas companies to address methane pollution. The BBBA would invest nearly $300B in clean energy tax credits. These work as incentives for the manufacturing of clean electricity, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and will help towards decarbonizing the industrial sector. By growing the domestic supply chain of solar, wind, and electric vehicle industries, the bill is expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. An additional $12B will go toward consumer rebates, which would make shifting to renewable energy more affordable for Americans. The plan invests $3B in grants for environmental justice communities for community capacity building and pollution reduction. A new Clean Energy Accelerator program will directly fund clean energy projects and deliver 40% of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. The BBBA would also create a new Civilian Climate Corps, which will employ 300,000 Americans in a new climate workforce in their own communities. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House will vote on the BBBA act this coming week. The bill also commits billions to supporting Indigenous climate leadership, climate-smart agriculture, healthy forests and land conservation. In addition to the Build Back Better Act, Congress passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill in November, which also invests billions in transitioning to clean energy and combating climate change.

      "‘If you have a climate crisis, the worst thing you could be doing is pouring more fuel on the fire’ — This grassroots organization wants governments to stop approving new gas infrastructure. The Coalition Opposing New Gas Stations (CONGAS) is a grassroots organization based in Sonoma County, CA co-founded by Woody Hastings and Jenny Baker after learning of a gas station proposal in a nearby area. So far, the organization has had a hand in stopping at least 3 new gas stations CONGAS believes that as the climate crisis intensifies, in large part to fossil fuel emissions from transportation, governments need to stop approving new gas infrastructure. This year, California has experienced more than 7,000 wildfires that have burned more than 3,000 homes and buildings. Scientists believe that global warming has intensified California's droughts and that this dries out the vegetation, which in turn fuels catastrophic wildfires. Gas stations are also harmful on a more local scale. Poisonous fumes escape when gas is spilled and underground storage tanks frequently leak, polluting surrounding soil and water. After a gas station closes it can be designated a 'brownfield site,' which is a property that might have been exposed to toxic substances or pollutants, and requires remediation before it can be redeveloped for other uses. People in CA are already expecting fewer gas stations in the future. In 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order banning the sale of new gas-powered cars after 2035. Petaluma, which is in Sonoma County, became the first city in CA to ban future gas station construction and expansion. The near term goals of CONGAS are to get similar bans instituted at a county level and provide resources for others who are interested in banning new gas stations in their own communities.

Chemicals known as phthalates are everywhere and research suggests they could be linked to approx 100k premature deaths every year. A study published on Oct 12 in the journal ‘Environmental Pollution’ found that a group of chemicals called phthalates might be responsible for approx 100k+ deaths per year in Americans aged 55-64. Dr. Leonardo Trasande is the study’s lead author and director of the NYU Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards. He says because of the materials phthalates are used in, and the nature of the chemicals themselves, they’re very easily absorbed by our bodies, which makes them that much more dangerous. Trasande says that when phthalates enter our bodies, the chemicals disrupt our hormones, resulting in inflammation which can spiral into heart disease, stroke, and other illnesses that can eventually lead to premature death. Trasande hopes his study’s findings push regulatory authorities to take steps to restrict phthalate use. Although it’s nearly impossible to completely avoid phthalates because they’re so ubiquitous and not always easy to recognize on product labels, here are some things you can do now to try to limit your exposure: 1. Limit your exposure to plastic containers. Use glass, ceramic, or metal instead. 2. If you have to use plastic, don’t microwave it. Heating phthalates will cause them to leech into your food. 3. Avoid using artificial fragrances, as phthalates are used to make scents last longer. Plastic \n",

Climate change is displacing people all over the world, only to have them meet environmental justice in the U.S. Climate migration is affecting many individuals who are forced to flee their homes across the globe, due to the effects of climate change on things like crop production, water access, and income. Pita Juarez is a filmmaker and environmental justice advocate who moved to Arizona from Guatemala. She has been inspired by social issues that affect underserved communities and aims to open discussions on important issues. Many climate migrants have left their homes to seek opportunities in the U.S. that could lead them to a better life. But climate change is also affecting disadvantaged communities in the states where many low-income and BIPOC communities face environmental injustices. Studies have shown that people of color are more likely to engage in climate activism. But Juarez says that in order to combat the environmental injustices they are facing, those voices need to be heard and listened to. The Build Back Better framework released by President Biden and Democratic congressional leadership would be a breakthrough in how the U.S. addresses climate change.

Countries are expected to bring new and ambitious emissions targets through updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) that will position them to reach net-zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century. This will require countries to commit to specific changes such as phasing-out coal, reducing deforestation, transitioning to electric vehicles, and boosting investments in renewables. By working together, countries will lay the foundation to help move the world to a net-zero economy. At COP26, the focus will be on finalizing the Paris Rulebook to implement the Paris agreement and tackle the climate crisis through collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society.

A warming Arctic can catapult the world into climate disaster through feedback loops that impact the entire planet. Julienne Stroeve is an Arctic ice expert and a Canada-150 Research Chair in Climate Forcing of Sea Ice at the University of Manitoba. She studies Arctic snow and ice feedback loops. Stroeve says it’s not just snow and ice melt that we need to worry about. As the Arctic warms, permafrost, a layer of soil that typically remains frozen for a period of 2+ years, melts and causes another type of feedback loop. She says these Arctic feedback loops have a detrimental effect on the planet as a whole. Stroeve says this doesn't mean that climatic trends in the Arctic are more important than those elsewhere, but people need to realize that they are intricately connected. ClimateChange \n",

      "Researchers have discovered an ingredient that could be a game-changer for batteries — here’s what you need to know. Peat could be the game-changing ingredient for batteries. Researchers at Estonia's University of Tartu have discovered a way to use peat, a layer of soil that is relatively plentiful in northern Europe, in sodium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Sodium-ion batteries are an alternative to the dominant lithium-ion batteries which are becoming more and more expensive due to their use of earth metals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Last year, global demand for lithium was approx. 320k tonnes. This is expected to grow to 1M tonnes by 2025 and 3 million tonnes by 2030. Peat could be a cheap option for sodium-ion batteries, as it isn’t used for agriculture or fuel, and it produces a good-quality carbon powder, according to the researchers. Decomposed peat is put into a high-temperature furnace for 2-3 hours to convert it into the powder, which is then used in the batteries. However, peat bogs also sequesters an enormous amount of carbon—1/3rd of the world’s soil carbon—and removing it can release large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Only 3% of the land area on Earth is covered by peatland, making these habitats rare. It’s unclear if this new technology takes this into account or what its effects on global warming-causing emissions would be. Batteries \n",

The warming Arctic is destroying these communities which were originally built on solid permafrost. Permafrost covers 65% of Russia’s land, more than 15 million people live on permafrost foundations across Russia. Much of the infrastructure was built with the assumption of stable permafrost as it had stayed frozen for millennia, but now the country is warming 2.8 times faster than the global average. Climate change is causing the land to crumble or cave in on itself and some areas are sinking by up to 12 cms annually. Buildings are sinking and collapsing, roads are being damaged, underground pipelines are at risk, and a deforming runway caused a local airport to shut down in the 90s. Yeh-gore Dyachkovsky is a villager who built his home 5 years ago at Churupcha. Originally it was raised 30 centimeters off of the ground on stilts. Now that gap is a meter wide. He has already brought 5 truckloads of soil to try and fill the gap, but needs more.

Some insurance companies that cover fossil fuel companies are failing to pay for damages linked to climate change. Tony Dunn used to study fire behavior for the U.S. Forest Service. When he was stuck in his car during the 2018 Camp Fire in California, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Dunn and his wife lost everything but their cars and lives in the fire. Their home was reduced to ashes. Dunn says the last thing he wanted to do was fight with his insurance company, but now, 3 years after the loss of his property, he says he’s still fighting. According to Insure our Future, a coalition of NGOs and social movements, some U.S. insurers underwrite coal, oil, and gas companies, enabling the expansion of fossil fuel drilling and mining operations which increase emissions and contribute to climate change. So why do people needing insurance in the age of climate-related disasters often face an uphill battle? Dunn doesn’t think it’s being done intentionally, but does think that it’s motivated by financial losses versus gains. Dunn now lives in the mountains of North Carolina and says he used to be of the mindset that climate change wouldn’t affect him and his family. He says he’s come to the realization that climate change is everywhere and after this debacle with his insurance company he has some words of advice: ‘We all have to start thinking about this. The time to go—to think, ‘Oh, this will happen to somebody else,’ or ‘It’s not gonna happen to me,’ that time is done.

      "The industrialization of food harshly impacts developing countries — but growing more indigenous foods might offer a solution. This video was created in partnership with Eat Forum, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and the IKEA Foundation. Our global farming system has failed to feed the world’s population but growing more diverse foods might be a way to fix this. Despite producing enough food in a year to feed the plant, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization found that an estimated 2.4 billion people faced moderate to severe food insecurities in 2020. Laura Pereira is a researcher at Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stellenbosch University, and Utrecht University. Her research focuses on the industrialization of the food system and how it affects developing countries. Between 1960 and 2000, yields for those primary crops rose dramatically in developing countries: 208% for wheat, 109% for rice, 157% for maize, 78% for potatoes, and 36% for cassava. Although the green revolution’s goal was to create more food for the planet, subsidies incentivized the production of single crops and we ended up with too much of those foods. Alternative uses for these crops had to be explored. In the US, for example, corn has been so heavily subsidized that farmers grew too much for the population to eat so now it’s used in things like bio fuel, animal feed, fructose syrup, and adhesives. Another effect of this boost in production, Pereira says, is a reduction in the production of less profitable crops that could provide a more balanced diet. While communities are increasingly focused on growing cash crops for their economic benefits they are also moving further away from growing food to meet their own nutritional needs. Pereira says that one solution to this problem is to grow more food that is indigenous to the land, rather than applying technology to grow foreign crops. This would decrease monoculture, help reduce the need to buy cheap unhealthy food, and provide a larger variety of foods to get nutrients from. Food \n",

The potential climate impact of the War on Terror is staggering, according to U.S. Army veteran Erik Edstrom. Edstrom is a West Point graduate, author, and former U.S. Army infantry officer who got out of the military after serving Afghanistan to study climate change and finance at Oxford University. Edstrom says the 20-year-long Afghanistan War contributed enough carbon emissions to kill multitudes of people. His assessment is based on studies such as one published in Nature Communications, which estimated that approx 4,400 metric tons of CO2 emissions is enough to kill one person. The U.S. Department of Defense is required to report its energy use to the Department of Energy’s Federal Energy Management Program. In FY2020, total estimated DoD greenhouse gas emissions based solely on fuel usage data were more than 51 million metric tons of CO2. That figure includes emissions from standard day-to-day operations as well as emissions from non-standard operations such as combat support, law enforcement, emergency response, and spaceflight. Edstrom says there’s more to be concerned with than just operating emissions. Edstrom says the U.S. Department of Defense budget, which in fiscal year 2021 was more than $703 billion, is bolstered by fear. He thinks Americans’ fears are misguided. Edstrom thinks the future military will be more electric, but says requiring the military-industrial complex to report the full scope of its emissions, beyond just fuel usage, is a crucial step in getting there.

Kelp forests help store CO2 and mitigate climate change. Now drones are being used to restore their populations. California’s kelp forests collapsed in 2013 when hot water swept the coastline and a mysterious syndrome caused a mass die-off of sea stars. The sea star deaths threw the ecosystem out of balance. Urchins, which eat kelp, flourished into overpopulation and other factors such as warming water and acidification caused the kelp coverage to decrease drastically. The drones move in a ‘lawnmower pattern’ flying back and forth in straight lines while taking pictures. Those photos are stitched together and then run through a computer program analyzing which pixels contain kelp. The kelp maps are used to plan restoration projects, such as trapping sea urchins or introducing sea otters.

Diversifying our diets with more seafood could help drastically reduce the damage caused to our planet and its biodiversity. Estimates suggest that meat and dairy industries create 7.1 gigatons of greenhouses gases annually. This accounts for 14.5% of the total man-made emissions and contributes to the impacts of climate change. Malin Jonell is a researcher at Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University. Her research focuses on sustainable food production and the role seafood, or ‘blue food,’ can play in future food systems. Jonell sees two major benefits of introducing more blue foods into our diets: healthier people and a healthier planet. Currently, our ocean is facing ecological challenges due to habitat destruction, overfishing, and abandoned fishing gear left behind in the water. So Jonell suggests that while focusing on consuming more seafood, more emphasis should be placed on consuming low impact blue food. For more people to consume lesser-known seafood, Jonell says more education and outreach needs to be done. Jonell is currently a researcher for the Blue Food Assessment, a scientific initiative, consisting of 100 scientists from more than 25 institutions.

This technique, known as cloud brightening, is being used across a section of Australia's Great Barrier Reef to protect vulnerable corals from bleaching due to climate change and the warming of the ocean. A turbine is used to spray microscopic particles of sea water into the air to thicken existing clouds and reduce sunlight over the coral reef ecosystem. According to project leader Dr. Daniel Harrison, the water droplets evaporate, leaving tiny salt crystals which travel into the Atmosphere allowing water vapor to condense and form clouds. This is the project's second trial, as researchers gather data on when corals are most at risk. Researchers believe that the benefits of cloud brightening can lessen over time unless climate change slows down. Oceans \n",

The climate crisis is expected to worsen the frequency and severity of extreme weather, like the hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and extreme heat that the U.S. is currently facing. Here’s what you need to know about the Build Back Better Act and how it could help lead America in the right direction in the fight against climate change. The Build Back Better Act would create an energy efficiency and clean electricity performance program, which would help to modernize America’s electric grid. Passage of the act would bring the U.S. closer to reaching President Biden’s goals of reaching 100% clean electricity by 2035, cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030, and getting to a net-zero economy by 2050. The Build Back Better Act would extend and expand clean energy and electric vehicle tax credits for businesses and consumers, to spur demand for domestic manufacturing. The CEPP program would create nearly 8 million jobs in the U.S. over 10 years. It would also enlist a civilian climate corps to put a new diverse generation of Americans to work conserving our public lands and waters and advancing environmental justice. BuildBackBetter \n",

Organizers say they aim to raise awareness about the connections between raising animals for food in mass quantities and how that affects the climate and planetary health. Daring Foods says their plant-based chicken is made with only 5 ingredients: water, soy protein concentrate, sunflower oil, a spice blend, and salt. Operating in an environmentally friendly manner, the food truck is solar-powered with lithium-ion batteries onboard, and all of the trash is thrown in compostable bins with plant-based bag liners. In addition to the free chicken satay, WAP gave passerby’s information about ‘Meating Halfway,’ a meat consumption reduction guide.

Blake and Stephanie Alexandre are fifth-generation farmers and the owners of Alexandre Family Farm in Northern California—the first certified regenerative organic dairy farm in the U.S. Regenerative farming focuses on soil health and rebuilding healthy organic matter within the soil and improving carbon sequestration properties. One of the most important components of regenerative farming is compost. Instead of treating the soil with synthetic fertilizers, the Alexandres and other regenerative farmers utilize compost, which is basically broken down organic matter that improves soil structure and fertility. Blake says that although it’s not difficult to convert to regenerative farming methods, most farmers have been taught and what’s been handed down to them are industrial farming methods using synthetic fertilizers and non-organic materials. He’s trying to change those methods. The Alexandres say that aside from the farmers, it’s up to consumers to make choices that are healthier for the environment and in turn, healthier for our bodies.

Suzie Flores and her husband Jay grow food-grade sugar kelp at Stonington Kelp Co. off the coast of Connecticut. They sell this seaweed to local restaurants and shops using a system with ropes that requires zero inputs like fertilizer. As it grows, the kelp absorbs carbon and nitrogen from the water and turns it into a nutrient-dense food. 132 countries around the world have the conditions to start seaweed aquaculture off their coasts. But only 37 currently do so. Not only can seaweed farming increase food security, but it can also sequester carbon. Seaweed \n",

The building uses solar panels, geothermal wells, and heat recovery systems to reportedly generate approximately 485k kilowatt hours annually. Some home builders are transitioning to ‘zero net energy’ in order to keep up with the green energy transition. And it doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Bruce Sullivan, the technical director for Zero Energy Project, explains how. CORRECTION: At 0:58 the above video should read '10.6k kWh or 10,000 kWh' not 10.6 kWh. Energy \n",

Deb Haaland, outlined the Biden admin’s new actions to protect public lands. Sec. Haaland thanked Pres. Biden for working to ‘permanently protect the homelands of our ancestors.’ On October 8, President Biden signed executive orders restoring protections to 4 different U.S. national monuments, most notably Bears Ears & Grand Staircase-Escalante Nat’l Monuments in Utah. Areas of both public monuments are considered sacred to local Native groups. By signing the exec. orders, Biden reversed Pres. Trump’s 2017 decision to dramatically reduce the size of both Bears Ears & Grand Staircase-Escalante. According to NPR, Trump’s downsizing of the two national monuments was the largest public lands reversal of its kind in U.S. history. Trump’s decision was praised by conservatives & many private interest groups at the time, but widely condemned by Indigenous communities and environmental activists. In a speech before his signing ceremony, Biden explained how these executive orders can be paired with the rest of his ‘Build Back Better’ agenda in fighting the climate crisis. Indigenous \n",

      "Should I stop eating meat? Meat requires approximately 10x more water than beans to produce — here’s how plant-based alternatives can help save our planet. This video was created in partnership with Eat Forum, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and the IKEA Foundation. If the global population adopted a “flexitarian” diet—where a certain percentage of meat and dairy is replaced by plant-based alternatives—we could save just over 5 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions per year by 2050. That is 12% of global CO2 emissions, which we need to halve in the next decade. Plant-based diets could also help us save water. Producing just one pound of beef requires 1,800 gallons of water. Whereas beans, which also serve as a source of protein, require approximately 10 times less water to produce. Diets with heavy amounts of processed red meat can also lead to health issues. If you’re trying to eat less meat, know there are guides out there to help you eat more sustainably. One is the Planetary Health Diet by the Eat-Lancet Commission. Moral of the story—if we adopt better eating habits, like a flexitarian diet, then it’s a win-win scenario: healthy humans, healthy planet. Meat \n",

Many factories have been forced to shut down, millions of households have lost power, and the demand for Chinese goods has doubled since the pandemic making it hard to keep up. Chinese authorities have begun rationing power as the price of imported coal is on the rise. This is a result of China’s choice to stop purchasing coal from Australia after political tension arose around how Beijing handled the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, China's five-year plan to reduce carbon emissions reduced their use of coal but recent cold weather has created greater demand for the fuel. The crisis has impacted Chinese citizens, production, and the world economy. With winter approaching, Chinese citizens are reportedly losing power and cannot heat their homes, according to Time Magazine. Factories struggle to meet their global demands for Chinese goods. Foreign businesses are looking elsewhere to fulfill their production needs. The central government is also concerned that the higher energy prices will cause an increase in prices for consumers. While looking for resolutions, the power shortage could harm Chinese President Xi Jinping's plan to make China carbon neutral by 2060. Energy \n",

Deep-sea mining is the process of extracting minerals like manganese, copper, and nickel from depths of over 200 meters. The big appeal behind it is that we need these minerals to develop sustainable technology that'll help us mitigate the climate crisis. Because these materials are becoming harder to find on land, companies want to continue their harvesting under the ocean. But deep-sea mining would destroy ecosystems — some of which haven't been named or even discovered.

      "Why are there fewer trees in redlined neighbourhoods? The racist practice of redlining from the 1930s could be the reason why some communities have fewer trees than others — here's how we can reverse this trend and make cities more resilient to climate change.  The disparity in tree cover in cities is not random. It's connected back to a racist practice called redlining, which began in the 1930s. Areas getting labeled as 'hazardous' because they had large Black populations led to disinvestment, poverty, and a wealth gap between white and Black families, the effects of which are still felt today. And it also led to fewer trees. Less tree cover means hotter temperatures, less flood control, more pollution, and during heat waves, more death. That's because the more trees a neighborhood has, the more resilient it is to climate change. Creating urban forestry jobs and building tree equity could reverse this dangerous trend.

Firefighters battled the 'very active' fire despite snowfall and frigid conditions. According to Storyful News, firefighters said conditions were so cold that their water pumps froze. The area's second fire, in the nearby city of Lakewood, reportedly burned 400+ acres and led to similar evacuations. Officials believe the Lakewood fire was human-caused.

      "(warning: distressing images) A red tide bloom, likely caused by a mixture of warm water temperatures and nutrient runoff, has killed fish, rays, and even sharks in San Francisco Bay, San Pablo Bay, and South Bay in California.  Jon Rosenfield, a scientist with San Francisco Baykeeper, said the bloom’s scope and duration was ‘unprecedented,’ with sturgeon, bat rays, striped bass, yellowfin gobies, and even sharks found dead. The dominant algae, identified as Heterosigma akashiwo, has caused ‘rust-colored’ waters and is likely suffocating marine life. Scientists said that while it is difficult to tie global warming and the climate crisis to any specific mass fish die-off, warming waters make algal blooms like this more likely. California’s Water Board recommends that people and pets avoid going into the water until the red tide is over. ‘The only solution here is prevention, and prevention involves treating the wastewater to a higher threshold than is normally done. The technology for that exists. It’s expensive. One way of dealing with this problem would be to use nature-based solutions such as treatment wetlands, natural wetlands,’ Rosenfield said. ‘But really we need the infrastructure to deal with this large volume of wastewater that comes from all the Bay Area’s residents. We need to treat this wastewater to a higher level. That’s gonna cost a lot of money.’ Earth \n",

The damage to infrastructure and farmland could also kick off a food security crisis. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC and obtained by Reuters show the scale of the flooding in and across Pakistan’s provinces.

Most of the recovery has happened in the central and northern stretches of the reef, where average hard coral cover grew from 13% in 2017 to 36% in 2022. The Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS) defines anything over 30% coral cover as ‘high value.’ Scientists are still concerned about the reef because, in the southern regions, hard coral cover has actually dropped from 38% in 2021 to 34% in 2022. They noted that much of the coral cover growth has been Acropora corals, which are more vulnerable to threats such as waves, heat, and the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish. Earth \n",

Project Nexus is set to launch in mid-October, covering a 500-foot portion of canal in Hickman, CA, and a mile in Ceres, CA.  Brandi McKuin, a project scientist at the University of California, Merced whose 2021 research inspired the project, listed the benefits: ‘First of all, covering canals with solar panels would reduce evaporation so we could save water. Secondly, it would avoid land use. Thirdly, it could, you know, by shading the canals with solar panels, it would reduce aquatic weed growth. And lastly, there’s a cooler microclimate. So water heats up more slowly than land, and this could enhance the efficiency of PV (Photovoltaic) electricity production.’ McKuin’s calculations found that if all 4,000 miles of CA’s canals were covered with solar panels, the state could save up to 63 billion gallons of water from evaporation. The panels could create as much as a sixth of the energy capacity that the state already has installed. Earth \n",

The grid failure led a number of politicians such as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to falsely claim that renewable energy was to blame, although a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission / North American Electric Reliability Corp. joint report showed that 87% of the outages were caused by natural gas fuel supply issues. One year later, not a whole lot has been done to remedy the issues. The National Resources Defense Council says increased electric transmission lines, as laid out in the Build Back Better agenda, would provide additional reliability while cutting energy costs for consumers, but that bill is currently stalled in Congress.

      "Solar power is helping some school districts increase teachers’ salaries — here’s how. As of 2020, 7,332 schools nationwide have installed solar power, 5.5% of the nations K-12 private and public schools. This means more than 5.3 million students go to a school with solar power and as of 2020, solar schools have 1,365 megawatts of total installed capacity, which is enough to power 254,030 U.S. homes. Much of this growth has happened in California, where 45% of the solar school capacity exists. California is one of 28 states (plus D.C.) that have approved purchasing power agreements for schools. This allows a third party, typically a developer, to pay for installation and maintenance of the panels. The school then buys back that solar power, usually at lower rates than buying from a utility company. Generation 180, which released the 2020 report on solar schools, said that there are many incentives for schools to install. Energy is the 2nd largest expense for U.S. schools at 8 billion per year. So producing solar would save money in a major way for the school districts. The Batesville School District in Arkansas installed 759 kW of solar, and upgraded to be more energy efficient. They've seen nearly $300k/year in savings, and expects savings of at least $2.4M over 20 years. A portion of the money saved has been put into teachers salaries. Outside of economical interests, students are exposed to technology in a real-world way and some even get job training. The nature of solar also allows for backup power, if the grid experiences outages and schools can easily be turned into emergency shelter during natural disasters. SolarPower \n",

Handcrafted by refugees in the community, the company raises awareness of the global refugee crisis while providing job employment, paths to citizenship, assisting in application fees, and scholarships. In 2018, founder Mohamed Malim, a former Somali refugee, saw the images of Syrian refugees crossing the Mediterranean Sea and the piles of life jackets littered on the shore of Lesbos, Greece. He wanted to do something to prevent the life jackets from further polluting the oceans while raising refugee awareness and helping the community. To create these bracelets, life jackets are collected each month and shipped to the Epimonia studio. Once they arrive, the life jackets are washed and line dried. Once dried, the life jackets are cut into pieces and stitched together with a leather or vegan backing. Once the pieces are together, metal clasps are added, and the bracelet is complete. The company produces up to 150 bracelets a week and has sold 7,000 bracelets to date since. All of Epimonia’s products directly support refugees at every level, because Malim hopes that all refugees receive the same level of support that he and his family felt when they arrived in the U.S. Refugees \n",

      "Two months after Hurricane Ian touched down in southwest Florida, a harmful red tide is continuing to plague shores in the area, killing dozens of fish. These harmful algae blooms are believed to stem from the rainwater and storm surges Ian caused when it hit the state in late September. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, red tide happens when colonies of algae produce rapidly and create toxins that can suffocate and kill marine life. Beachgoers have been asked to limit their contact with the algae, as some have reported eye and lung irritation after exposure. Environmental engineer Tracy Fanara told Fox Weather that consuming fish caught locally might be dangerous, as they might have ingested toxic algae from the red tide. In some cases, humans could become sick and die. This video was made with support from Climate Power.  Earth \n",

      "At least two buildings collapsed and multiple others were endangered in Juneau, Alaska, after a major glacial dam outburst on August 5 caused the Mendenhall Lake to reach record highs. The city and borough of Juneau issued a local declaration of emergency. Glacial outburst flooding first began in Juneau in 2011. It happens when water in a side basin of the Mendenhall Glacier builds up enough pressure to push through the glacier, which generally acts as a dam. The water rushes through the glacier and into the Mendenhall Lake, and on to the river, which floods. According to the Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center, thinning ice has caused drastic changes to the area’s glaciers over recent decades. Previously, Suicide Basin, where the floodwater originates, was where the Suicide Glacier ran into the Mendenhall Glacier. Now, the Suicide Glacier has retreated, so the basin is filled with rain and meltwater. Research has found that global warming and climate change heavily impact glaciers. The number, area, and volume of glacial lakes, have drastically grown around the world since 1990 as ice volume has decreased. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in 2021 that the world needed to stop approving and developing new oil and gas projects if we were to halt warming at 1.5ºC. However, President Joe Biden recently approved the Willow Project in Alaska, allowing ConocoPhillips to pull millions of barrels of oil out of the Alaskan wilderness.  Glacier \n",

      "Climate activists from the group Futuro Vegetal spray-painted Walmart heir Nancy Walton Laurie’s $300 million superyacht on July 16 as it was leaving Ibiza, Spain. Crew on the superyacht immediately tried to wash the paint off, as activists held up a sign saying ‘You consume, others suffer.’ The action was part of a campaign called ‘Jets and Yachts, the party is over,’ which was convened by another group, Extinction Rebellion Ibiza. Other actions included dumping paint on a luxury car and a private plane. Futuro Vegetal is asking Spain’s government to use the money that usually goes toward subsidizing the meat industry for a sustainable food system instead. The actions come as much of the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing extreme heat and after what is believed to be the hottest 7 days in modern history. ‘The activists have shown a banner where you could read ‘You consume, others suffer’ since it is the people who are at the top of the social pyramid who put all the planet’s life at their service, forcing us to work to uphold their system, exploiting animals and destroying the land regardless of how much suffering and death it means,’ Futuro Vegetal said in a statement. ‘Only the union of the people against the necropolitics of the powerful is capable of generating a change in the agri-food system that allows us to mitigate the worst consequences of Climate Chaos.’  Walmart \n",

The activists pointed to a decision by the highest administrative court in France in what was called the 'Case of the Century,’ which found the country partially responsible for harm to the environment, ruling that the government must compensate for the damage and its failure to combat the climate crisis. Nicolas, one of the activists, said, ‘Today, our goal was simply to denounce a state that has officially committed a crime, since it has been convicted in the 'Trial of the Century' last year, and this conviction ordered the state to fix its negative climate impacts by December 31, 2022. This has not been the case, as we could see in the news, since greenhouse gas emissions have not or only barely gone down in 2022. So today, the state is officially guilty.’  Earth \n",

Super typhoon Mawar hit the island of 150,000 people with 'high winds, heavy rains and a dangerous storm surge that swamped low-lying areas as residents hunkered down in homes and shelters,' per the AP. Mawar’s winds were clocked at 150 mph in some locations, making it the equivalent of what would be a Category 4 Atlantic hurricane on the East Coast of the U.S. Several other areas of Micronesia, the Pacific region in which Guam is situated, were also under typhoon or tropical storm warnings today.

The climate activists, who were singing and shouting, had to be individually carried out, and some even tried to get on the stage where CEO Wael Sawan and the board of directors were sitting. The meeting was delayed by at least an hour. This wasn’t the first protest of this kind — last year, the meeting was delayed 3 hours by climate activists. Protester Katie Burrell said to Reuters, ‘If I had someone from Shell in front of me, I would just appeal to them. They're so clever, and they have tremendous skills and abilities inside their company, and I think you can use that for good. It's not as if it's not possible to make a company do less bad.’ ‘You know, start now, do more,’ Burrell continued. 'We are in the climate crisis, it's knocking at the gates of Europe now and we've got to make a difference. And so, you know, their children are going to be affected. They're going to be affected.
